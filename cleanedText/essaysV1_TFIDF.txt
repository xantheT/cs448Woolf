the son of royal langbrith mr howells is the exponent of the novel of thought as distinct from the novel of action men interest him primarily as thinking not as doing animals the son of royal langbrith is another experiment in this line and one that has a singular interest the outline of the story is this there was a certain royal langbrith an owner of papermills in a new england town he has been long dead when the book opens so that his child knows him only through the words of the widow which for a good reason are few but the son has contrived to make a hero of his father and a church and a village library are proofs of the munificence of the dead man we are soon let into the secret however which is the property of the widow one dr anther and two others that the publicspirited royal langbrith is a grotesque myth he was in reality a scoundrel who got his wealth by appropriating the inventions of another but as he was not exposed in his lifetime there seems no need why the unpleasant truth should be told now except for this reason dr anther and mrs langbrith are old friends and wish to marry the fatal objection being that the son james reveres his fathers memory so deeply that for his mother to remarry would be sacrilege mrs langbrith is weak and cannot face her sons displeasure nor give him the reasons that make his fathers memory anything but venerable as he grows up he enlarges upon the paternal virtues to such an extent as to present a medallion of his father to the library the one person from whose lips james would naturally learn his fathers character is the unfortunate hawberk whose inventions were stolen and who was ousted from his partnership in the prosperity of the mills by a threat to disclose a slightly discreditable past to his wife but his hardship makes him take to opiumeating and in his dreams he cherishes the delusion that langbrith was his best friend indeed all things combine to make it necessary for the living to shield the memory of the dead man even at their own sacrifice the chief sufferers are mrs langbrith and the highminded dr anther whose conscience will not let him disabuse the son of his romantic ideal although this ideal puts an end to his own chance of happiness it does in fact happen as anther foretold mrs langbrith consents to marry him without telling her son the truth about his father james when he hears of the engagement accuses both of infidelity to his fathers memory mrs langbrith has not the courage to withstand him and breaks off the engagement at this point the opiumeating hawberk recovers and his delusions about royal langbrith disappear he decides however as james langbrith is in love with his daughter that royals crimes did enough harm in their day and that there is no reason to let them affect the lives of the next generation he dies suddenly without breathing the secret to any one james langbrith meanwhile in disgust at his mother and anther had migrated to paris he returns on hearing of hawberks death and in the train meets the fourth person who can tell him his fathers true history his uncle john john is moved by an insulting comparison between him and royal who was at least a gentleman to show what kind of gentleman he was which he does with great power and effect the result is that james reaches his mothers house crushed and prepared to accept her marriage and learns from her that dr anther is just dead of typhoid the book ends very naturally with the happy marriage of james and hope hawberk and the population of saxmills is suffered after consideration to revere the medallion of royal langbrith as that of a good man and citizen the weak point of the book seems to us to lie in the fact of jamess devotion to his father on which the plot mainly depends he had no materials for his worship except a few vague words of his mother the library and a not very pleasant portrait and yet it is for this reason that over twenty years after her husbands death he objects to his mothers remarriage it would be more natural to object not that his father should have a successor but that he himself should have a stepfather another however is personally acceptable and his sole disqualification is that he is to succeed royal langbirth it is difficult to believe that a young mans devotion to a father whom he could not remember would lead him to such extravagances however the mere plot is not essential to a book which treats with such fineness of subtler things the grasp of the dead hand is felt in every page and the book is full of fine observation and delicate characterdrawing it is needless to say that the whole is beautifully proportioned and told in the reserved and expressive language of a man who has much skill in writing haworth november i do not know whether pilgrimages to the shrines of famous men ought not to be condemned as sentimental journeys it is better to read carlyle in your own study chair than to visit the soundproof room and pore over the manuscripts at chelsea i should be inclined to set an examination on frederick the great in place of entrance fee only in that case the house would soon have to be shut up the curiosity is only legitimate when the house of a great writer or the country in which it is set adds something to our understanding of his books this justification you have for a pilgrimage to the home and country of charlotte bronte and her sisters the life by mrs gaskell gives you the impression that haworth and the brontes are somehow inextricably rnixed haworth expresses the brontes the brontes express haworth they fit like a snail to its shell how far surroundings radically affect peoples minds it is not for me to ask superficially the influence is great but it is worth asking if the famous parsonage had been placed in a london slum the dens of whitechapel would not have had the same result as the lonely yorkshire moors however i am taking away my only excuse for visiting haworth unreasonable or not one of the chief points of a recent visit to yorkshire was that an expedition to haworth could be accomplished the necessary arrangements were made and we determined to take advantage of the first fine day for our expedition a real northern snowstorm had been doing the honours of the moors it was rash to wait fine weather and it was also cowardly i understand that the sun very seldom shone on the bronte family and if we chose a really fine day we should have to make allowance for the fact that fifty years ago there were few fine days at haworth and that we were therefore for sake of comfort rubbing out half the shadows in the picture however it would be interesting to see what impression haworth could make upon the brilliant weather of settle we certainly passed through a very cheerful land which might be likened to a vast wedding cake of which the icing was slightly undulating the earth was bridal in its virgin snow which helped to suggest the comparison keighley pronounced keethly is often mentioned in the life it was the big town four miles from haworth in which charlotte walked to make her more important purchases her wedding gown perhaps and the thin little cloth boots which we examined under glass in the bronte museum it is a big manufacturing town hard and stony and clattering with business in the way of these northern towns they make small provision for the sentimental traveller and our only occupation was to picture the slight figure of charlotte trotting along the streets in her thin mantle hustled into the gutter by more burly passersby it was the keighley of her day and that was some comfort our excitement as we neared haworth had in it an element of suspense that was really painful as though we were to meet some longseparated friend who might have changed in the interval so clear an image of haworth had we from print and picture at a certain point we entered the valley up both sides of which the village climbs and right on the hilltop looking down over its parish we saw the famous oblong tower of the church this marked the shrine at which we were to do homage it may have been the effect of a sympathetic imagination but i think that there were good reasons why haworth did certainly strike one not exactly as gloomy but what is worse for artistic purposes as dingy and commonplace the houses built of yellowbrown stone date from the early nineteenth century they climb the moor step by step in little detached strips some distance apart so that the town instead of making one compact blot on the landscape has contrived to get a whole stretch into its clutches there is a long line of houses up the moorside which clusters round the church and parsonage with a little clump of trees at the top the interest for a bronte lover becomes suddenly intense the church the parsonage the bronte museum the school where charlotte taught and the bull inn where branwell drank are all within a stones throw of each other the museum is certainly rather a pallid and inanimate collection of objects an effort ought to be made to keep things out of these mausoleums but the choice often lies between them and destruction so that we must be grateful for the care which has preserved much that is under any circumstances of deep interest here are many autograph letters pencil drawings and other documents but the most touching case so touching that one hardly feels reverent in ones gaze is that which contains the little personal relics the dresses and shoes of the dead woman the natural fate of such things is to die before the body that wore them and because these trifling and transient though they are have survived charlotte bronte the woman comes to life and one forgets the chiefly memorable fact that she was a great writer her shoes and her thin muslin dress have outlived her one other object gives a thrill the little oak stool which emily carried with her on her solitary moorland tramps and on which she sat if not to write as they say to think what was probably better than her writing the church of course save part of the tower is renewed since bronte days but that remarkable churchyard remains the old edition of the life had on its titlepage a little print which struck the keynote of the book it seemed to be all graves gravestones stood ranked all round you walked on a pavement lettered with dead names the graves had solemnly invaded the garden of the parsonage itself which was as a little oasis of life in the midst of the dead this is no exaggeration of the artists as we found the stones seem to start out of the ground at you in tall upright lines like an army of silent soldiers there is no hands breadth untenanted indeed the economy of space is somewhat irreverent in old days a flagged path which suggested the slabs of graves led from the front door of the parsonage to the churchyard without interruption of wall or hedge the garden was practically the graveyard too the successors of the brontes however wishing a little space between life and death planted a hedge and several tall trees which now cut off the parsonage garden completely the house itself is precisely the same as it was in charlottes day save that one new wing has been added it is easy to shut the eye to this and then you have the square boxlike parsonage built of the ugly yellowbrown stone which they quarry from the moors behind precisely as it was when charlotte lived and died there inside of course the changes are many though not such as to obscure the original shape of the rooms there is nothing remarkable in a midvictorian parsonage though tenanted by genius and the only room which awakens curiosity is the kitchen now used as an anteroom in which the girls tramped as they conceived their work one other spot has a certain grim interest the oblong recess beside the staircase into which emily drove her bulldog during the famous fight and pinned him while she pommelled him it is otherwise a little sparse parsonage much like others of its kind it was due to the courtesy of the present incumbent that we were allowed to inspect it in his place i should often feel inclined to exorcise the three famous ghosts one thing only remained the church in which charlotte worshipped was married and lies buried the circumference of her life was very narrow here though much is altered a few things remain to tell of her the slab which bears the names of the succession of children and of their parents their births and deaths strikes the eye first name follows name at very short intervals they died maria the mother maria the daughter elizabeth branwell emily anne charlotte and lastly the old father who outlived them all emily was only thirty years old and charlotte but nine years older the sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to god which giveth us the victory through our lord jesus christ that is the inscription which has been placed beneath their names and with reason for however harsh the struggle emily and charlotte above all fought to victory nextdoor neighbours mr pett ridge is a gentleman who finds his best entertainment in london streets he is an openeyed and interested observer who overhears a few words jots them down in his notebook and passes on we can imagine that he is attracted by any little street incident and forms one of the crowd which collects round a fallen cabhorse or a drunken man he always chooses a seat next the driver of the omnibus and likes to enter into conversation with his fellowpassengers he has given us in this book the result of his observations in nineteen very short stories if stories they can be called they have no plot as a general rule but are rather a series of brief lanternslides which pass over the sheet and disappear the scenes are almost all laid in london back streets the figures are those of shopgirls policemen porters and clerks at railway stations they are for the most part very goodtempered slightly commonplace people who fall in love or dont fall in love in either case our sympathies are not very deeply stirred mr pett ridges plots certainly do not strike one as probable does a young lady behind a counter think it a point of honour to ask the fireman who rescues her to become her husband though she is at the time engaged to another according to mr pett ridge she does and the incident deserves to be made into a short story and bound up into a book these nineteen stories we are of opinion might with advantage have been left to adorn the columns of a daily paper for they are not of more than ephemeral interest on a faithful friend there is some impertinence as well as some foolhardiness in the way in which we buy animals for so much gold and silver and call them ours one cannot help wondering what the silent critic on the hearthrug thinks of our strange conventions the mystic persian whose ancestors were worshipped as gods whilst we their masters and mistresses grovelled in caves and painted our bodies blue she has a vast heritage of experience which seems to brood in her eyes too solemn and too subtle for expression she smiles i often think at our lateborn civilisation and remembers the rise and fall of dynasties there is something too profane in the familiarity half contemptuous with which we treat our animals we deliberately transplant a little bit of simple wild life and make it grow up beside ours which is neither simple nor wild you may often see in a dogs eyes a sudden look of the primitive animal as though he were once more a wild dog hunting in the solitary places of his youth how have we the impertinence to make these wild creatures forego their nature for ours which at best they can but imitate it is one of the refined sins of civilisation for we know not what wild spirit we are taking from its purer atmosphere or who it is pan or nymph or dryad that we have trained to beg for a lump of sugar at tea i do not think that in domesticating our lost friend shag we were guilty of any such crime he was essentially a sociable dog who had his near counterpart in the human world i can see him smoking a cigar at the bow window of his club his legs extended comfortably whilst he discusses the latest news on the stock exchange with a companion his best friend could not claim for him any romantic or mysterious animal nature but that made him all the better company for mere human beings he came to us however with a pedigree that had all the elements of romance in it he when in horror at his price his wouldbe purchaser pointed to his collie head and collie body but terribly skyeterrier legs he we were assured was no less a dog than the original skye a chieftain of the same importance as the obrien or the oconnor don in human aristocracy the whole of the skyeterrier tribe who that is inherited the paternal characteristics had somehow been swept from the earth shag the sole scion of true skye blood remained in an obscure norfolk village the property of a lowborn blacksmith who however cherished the utmost loyalty for his person and pressed the claims of his royal birth with such success that we had the honour of buying him for a very substantial sum he was too great a gentleman to take part in the plebeian work of killing rats for which he was originally needed but he certainly added we felt to the respectability of the family he seldom went for a walk without punishing the impertinence of middleclass dogs who neglected the homage due to his rank and we had to enclose the royal jaws in a muzzle long after that restriction was legally unnecessary as he advanced in middle life he became certainly rather autocratic not only with his own kind but with us his masters and mistresses such a title though was absurd where shag was concerned so we called ourselves his uncles and aunts the solitary occasion when he found it necessary to inflict marks of his displeasure on human flesh was once when a visitor rashly tried to treat him as an ordinary petdog and tempted him with sugar and called him out of his name by the contemptible lapdog title of fido then shag with characteristic independence refused the sugar and took a satisfactory mouthful of calf instead but when he felt that he was treated with due respect he was the most faithful of friends he was not demonstrative but failing eyesight did not blind him to his masters face and in his deafness he could still hear his masters voice the evil spirit of shags life was introduced into the family in the person of an attractive young sheepdog puppy who though of authentic breed was unhappily without a tail a fact which shag could not help remarking with satisfaction we deluded ourselves into the thought that the young dog might take the place of the son of shags old age and for a time they lived happily together but shag had ever been contemptuous of social graces and had relied for his place in our hearts upon his sterling qualities of honesty and independence the puppy however was a young gentleman of most engaging manners and though we tried to be fair shag could not help feeling that the young dog got most of our attention i can see him now as in a kind of blundering and shamefaced way he lifted one stiff old paw and gave it to me to shake which was one of the young dogs most successful tricks it almost brought the tears to my eyes i could not help thinking though i smiled of old king lear but shag was too old to acquire new graces no second place should be his and he determined that the matter should be decided by force so after some weeks of growing tension the battle was fought they went for each other with white teeth gleaming shag was the aggressor and rolled round and round on the grass locked in each others grip when at last we got them apart blood was running hair was flying and both dogs bore scars peace after that was impossible they had but to see each other to growl and stiffen the question was who was the conqueror who was to stay and who to go the decision we came to was base unjust and yet perhaps excusable the old dog has had his day we said he must give place to the new generation so old shag was deposed and sent to a kind of dignified dowerhouse at parsons green and the young dog reigned in his stead year after year passed and we never saw the old friend who had known us in the days of our youth but in the summer holidays he revisited the house in our absence with the caretaker and so time went on till this last year which though we did not know it was to be the last year of his life then one winters night at a time of great sickness and anxiety a dog was heard barking repeatedly with the bark of a dog who waits to be let in outside our kitchen door it was many years since that bark had been heard and only one person in the kitchen was able to recognise it now she opened the door and in walked shag now almost quite blind and stone deaf as he had walked in many times before and looking neither to right nor left went to his old corner by the fireside where he curled up and fell asleep without a sound if the usurper saw him he slunk guiltily away for shag was past fighting for his rights any more we shall never knowit is one of the many things that we can never know what strange wave of memory or sympathetic instinct it was that drew shag from the house where he had lodged for years to seek again the familiar doorstep of his masters home and it befell that shag was the last of the family to live in the old house for it was in crossing the road which leads to the gardens where he was taken for his first walks as a puppy and bit all the other dogs and frightened all the babies in their perambulators that he met his death the blind deaf dog neither saw nor heard a hansom and the wheel went over him and ended instantly a life which could not have been happily prolonged it was better for him to die thus out among the wheels and the horses than to end in a lethalchamber or be poisoned in a stableyard so we say farewell to a dear and faithful friend whose virtues we remember and dogs have few faults the feminine note in fiction mr courtney is certain that there is such a thing as the feminine note in fiction he desires moreover to define its nature in the book before us though at the start he admits that the feminine and masculine points of view are so different that it is difficult for one to understand the other at any rate he has made a laborious attempt it is perhaps partly for the reason just stated that he ends where he begins he gives us eight very patient and careful studies in the works of living women writers in which he outlines the plots of their most successful books in detail but we would have spared him the trouble willingly in exchange for some definite verdict we can all read mrs humphry ward for instance and remember her story but we want a critic to separate her virtues and her failings to assign her right place in literature and to decide which of her characteristics are essentially feminine and why and what is their significance mr courtney implies by his title that he will at any rate accomplish this last and it is with disappointment though not with surprise that we discover that he has done nothing of the kind is it not too soon after all to criticise the feminine note in anything and will not the adequate critic of women be a woman mr courtney we think feels something of this difficulty his introduction in which we expected to find some kind of summingup contains only some very tentative criticisms and conclusions women we gather are seldom artists because they have a passion for detail which conflicts with the proper artistic proportion of their work we would cite sappho and jane austen as examples of two great women who combine exquisite detail with a supreme sense of artistic proportion women again excel in close analytic miniature work they are more happy when they reproduce than when they create their genius is for psychological analysis all of which we note with interest though we reserve our judgment for the next hundred years or bequeath the duty to our successor yet it is worth noting as proof of the difficulty of the task which mr courtney has set himself that he finds two at least of his eight women writers artists that two others possess a strength which in this age one has to call masculine and in fact that no pair of them come under any one heading though of course in the same way as men they can be divided roughly into schools at any rate it seems to be clear according to mr courtney that more and more novels are written by women for women which is the cause he declares that the novel as a work of art is disappearing the first part of his statement may well be true it means that women having found their voices have something to say which is naturally of supreme interest and meaning to women but the value of which we cannot yet determine the assertion that the woman novelist is extinguishing the novel as a work of art seems to us however more doubtful it is at any rate possible that the widening of her intelligence by means of education and study of the greek and latin classics may give her that sterner view of literature which will make an artist of her so that having blurted out her message somewhat formlessly she will in due time fashion it into permanent artistic shape mr courtney has given us material for many questions such as these but his book has done nothing to prevent them from still remaining questions a belle of the fifties i have come upon no record of any other woman of her time who has filled so powerful a place politically whose belleship has been so long sustained or whose magnetism and compelling fascinations have swayed others so universally as those of mrs clayclopton so writes the lady to whom these memoirs were dictated and to confess that one has not heard of so distinguished a person argued at any rate a culpable ignorance of the america of the fifties indeed mrs clays memories show her she is still alive but the book reaches only to the year to have been a very important person in her day and in that day all kinds of stirring things came to pass her position as the wife of senator clement clay junior and her own personal gifts gave her not only the influence of her belleship as the quaint american has it but a real political power as well she was in fact an american version of our european great lady with certain characteristic differences and women of her type were commoner before than after the war all this makes her story well worth listening to and she tells it with the charming candour of the old who can dispense with the hesitations and selfconsciousness of those who have no such reason to be sure of themselves as we read we feel that we are one of the circle of great nephews and nieces who love to hear for the hundredth time perhaps what a brilliant and beautiful young woman this old lady of eighty was fifty years ago how many distinguished men admired her what dress she wore at mrs gwins famous fancydress ball in and those sadder memories which still have power to stir her blood of the war and the terrible days after the murder of lincoln mrs clay born virginia tunstall came of the aristocracy of america and was brought up in tuscaloosa the capital of alabama where the old aristocratic tradition of the south was splendidly preserved and the planters lived the lives of great english landowners with vast estates and retinues of slaves dependent on them all this was pleasant and as it should be and the little girl was brought up to honour three things religiously her name blood and section her bible and the richmond enquirer she early showed herself possessed of beauty an impulsive wit and great power of fascination she tells us how before she was fifteen she had her first bitter sorrow she fell desperately in love with a hero who proved to be already provided with wife and child and for twelve or fourteen hours she went through an agony of disappointment she recovered happily and soon afterwards married the rising young statesman clement clay immediately after their marriage he was elected a senator of the united states and thus began her brilliant career in political circles at washington here although she notes as early as the growing strain between the north and the south which made sovial civilities difficult between them society was almost feverishly gay the southerners by virtue of their inherited polish were the leaders of society and as we guess mrs clay was the leader of the southerners washington though the capital of a democracy was as rigidly divided into sets and these sets were as strictly ruled by their separate codes of etiquette as any capital that owns a court and a nobility the foreign ministers lent an air of distinction to the diplomatic gatherings and says mrs clay were the critics and mentors of the americans who were not so highly accomplished in the mess of the southerners she declares there was scarcely a man who had not won a conspicuous position in the nations affairs hardly a woman without wit or beauty the ladies indeed received tributes of admiration which are we are told of international fame there was the famous trio of beauties mrs pugh the perfect brunette mrs douglas the blonde mrs pryor a brunette of lighter complexion with soft brown hair and eyes and it was to mrs pugh that the austrian ambassador paid the compliment which is now as it deserves to be a classic in the capital it was at a dance at which pretty women thronged as the ministers gaze rested upon miss chalfant afterwards mrs pugh his eyes expanded with admiration approaching he knelt suddenly before her exclaiming madame i have from my empress a piece of precious lace and he fumbled alas vainly in his pockets as he spoke which her majesty has commanded me to present to the most beautiful woman in washington you you are more the most beautiful in the world i have not with me the lace but i will send it if you will permit me and he kept his word then there were other ladies miss walton madame de bodisco addie cutts and mrs pendleton whose portraits in the curls and crinolines of the fifties are given us to make good their longforgotten claim to belleship then we have the description in minute detail of the dress of fifty years ago how low necks and lace berthas were worn almost universally panelled skirts in which two materials a plain and embossed or embroidered fabric were combined and basques with postilion backs became the order of the day fine dress material we observe had to be bought abroad and made up at home thanks to mrs clay we are able to realise that the ladies who were covered with all this oldfashioned finery did really exist beneath the mass of artificialities which makes our own early victorian days so strangely unreal there is the delightful lady crittenden for instance who appears before us mountainous and stately with her dress slipping from her superbly moulded shoulders and her skirt extended over a monster crinoline a splendid monument of her time she was wont to boast of her perfect happiness which she accounts for thus i have been married three times and in each alliance i have got just what i wanted my first marriage was for love and it was mine as fully as i could wish my second for money and heaven was as good to me in this instance my third was for position and that too is mine what more could i ask there is a certain delightful freedom from restraint about the american witness also the senator who kept a supply of soft wood in his desk in the chamber which he whittled perpetually on one occasion into a heart during the sitting and blew kisses to the ladies gallery we cannot dwell further upon what are somewhat barbarously called the antebellum days nor can we do justice to the famous fancy dress ball to which mrs clay went dressed as aunt ruthy partington an american mrs malaprop and where she so distinguished herself with a flow of witticisms which did not cease all the evening that her husband declared when she married me america lost its siddons mrs clay was famous for her wit we gather and made so bold as to pun upon the english ambassadors name when she asked him whether some lovely american lady was likely to be lyonised but soon came the saddest day of my life when on january mr clay took up his portfolio and left the senate chamber the whole of the southern party went with him the capital was deserted and the four years war begun mrs clay was by birth and sympathy a southerner a lady of mr henry jamess latest novel mr henry james is one of the very few living writers who are sufficiently great to possess a point of view we know by this time what that point of view is and when we read a new book by him we do not expect to make discoveries but to look once more at familiar sights through the old spectacles and yet though he has written so much and so well this last book with its all but closely printed pages gives proof that he finds the old problems as engrossing as ever and is still toiling to say what he means to say all he means to leave nothing unsaid that can by any possibility complete the picture we may dispute his theory of what a novel ought to be but no one can deny that he brings gifts to the task which fail very little of firstrate quality and that in using them he employs a high conscientiousness which is as admirable as it is rare in the pages of his last book there is not one we may assert that bears traces of haste or carelessness there is not one that does not make one think not one that has not its own exquisite felicity of word or thought which alone would illumine a whole chapter of an ordinary novel the plot if one can call it so is of the slightest an episode an incident to be disposed of by the average novelist in ten pages or less everything that happens in the golden bowl might have happened to a score of people one knows but it needs skill of the very highest to make novels out of such everyday material mr james is one of the few who attempt to picture people as they are his work therefore always commands our respect and gratitude but again though he is almost overscrupulous not to exaggerate to see people as they are and the lives that they really lead it is naturally through his own eyes that he sees them mr jamess eyes we are often led to think must be provided with some extra fine lens the number of things he sees is so extraordinary it follows that his characters are similarly endowed the pages of the golden bowl are devoted to showing how four people met a certain natural difficulty which must frequently occur outside mr jamess novels but which can hardly ever one would imagine produce such an amount of thinking and analysing and hairsplitting as it does within them they are all four superlatively highminded and only too solicitous for each others happiness the book indeed tnight be called a study in the evils of unselfishness so much pain does their care for each other inflict the tragedy if that is not too strong a word is acted in dumb show a scene would have been impossible between all these wellbred and distinguished people but mr james has a singular power of intimating what four separate people are thinking and showing us the silent conflict of their thought without making his character speak or act the greater part of the book is taken up with a longdrawnout struggle for supremacy between two women but though there are vital interests at stake and all the force of both is put into the contest the battle and victory are eminently decorous and when speech is necessary the words are few and the voices are not raised it is after all a slight theme on which to spend so much ingenuity and we suffer from a surfeit of words for all the skill and care that have been spent on them the actors remain but so many distinguished ghosts we have been living with thoughts and emotions not with live people the effect of all this marvellous accumulation of detail all of it doubtless true all there to see if we look close enough obscures the main outlines mr james is like an artist who with a sure knowledge of anatomy paints every bone and muscle in the human frame the portrait would be greater as a work of art if he were content to say less and suggest more but mr james tortures himself and wearies his readers in his strenuous effort to get everything said that there is to say many overburdened sentences could be quoted as proof of this curious sense of duty this perception expanded on the spot as a flower one of the strangest might at a breath have suddenly opened she rubbed with her palm the polished mahogany of the balustrade which was mounted on fine ironwork eighteenthcentury english these are trivial instances of detail which perpetually insisted on fatigues without adding to the picture genius would have dissolved them and whole chapters of the same kind into a single word genius however is precisely what we do not find and it is for this reason that we do not count mr jamess characters among the creatures of our brains nor can we read his books easily and without conscious effort but when we have made this reservation our praise must be unstinted there is no living novelist whose standard is higher or whose achievement is so consistently great the decay of essaywriting the spread of education and the necessity which haunts us to impart what we have acquired have led and will lead still further to some startling results we read of the overburdened british museum how even its appetite for printed matter flags and the monster pleads that it can swallow no more this public crisis has long been familiar in private houses one member of the household is almost officially deputed to stand at the hall door with flaming sword and do battle with the invading armies tracts pamphlets advertisements gratuitous copies of magazines and the literary productions of friends come by post by van by messenger come at all hours of the day and fall in the night so that the morning breakfasttable is fairly snowed up with them this age has painted itself more faithfully than any other in a myriad of clever and conscientious though not supremely great works of fiction it has tried seriously to liven the faded colours of bygone ages it has delved industriously with spade and axe in the rubbishheaps and ruins and so far we can only applaud our use of pen and ink but if you have a monster like the british public to feed you will try to tickle its stale palate in new ways fresh and amusing shapes must be given to the old commodities for we really have nothing so new to say that it will not fit into one of the familiar forms so we confine ourselves to no one literary medium we try to be new by being old we revive mysteryplays and affect an archaic accent we deck ourselves in the fine raiment of an embroidered style we cast off all clothing and disport ourselves nakedly in short there is no end to our devices and at this very moment probably some ingenious youth is concocting a fresh one which be it ever so new will grow stale in its turn if there are thus an infinite variety of fashions in the external shapes of our wares there are a certain numbernaturally not so many of wares that are new in substance and in form which we have either invented or very much developed perhaps the most significant of these literary inventions is the invention of the personal essay it is true that it is at least as old as montaigne but we may count him the first of the moderns it has been used with considerable frequency since his day but its popularity with us is so immense and so peculiar that we are justified in looking upon it as something of our own typical characteristic a sign of the times which will strike the eye of our greatgreatgrandchildren its significance indeed lies not so much in the fact that we have attained any brilliant success in essaywriting no one has approached the essays of elia but in the undoubted facility with which we write essays as though this were beyond all others our natural way of speaking the peculiar form of an essay implies a peculiar substance you can say in this shape what you cannot with equal fitness say in any other a very wide definition obviously must be that which will include all the varieties of thought which are suitably enshrined in essays but perhaps if you say that an essay is essentially egoistical you will not exclude many essays and you will certainly include a potentous number almost all essays begin with a capital i i think i feel and when you have said that it is clear that you are not writing history or philosophy or biography or anything but an essay which may be brilliant or profound which may deal with the immortality of the soul or the rheumatism in your left shoulder but is primarily an expression of personal opinion we are not there is alas no need to prove it more subject to ideas than our ancestors we are not i hope in the main more egoistical but there is one thing in which we are more highly skilled than they are and that is in manual dexterity with a pen there can be no doubt that it is to the art of penmanship that we owe our present literature of essays the very great of old homer and aeschylus could dispense with a pen they were not inspired by sheets of paper and gallons of ink no fear that their harmonies passed from lip to lip should lose their cadence and die but our essayists write because the gift of writing has been bestowed on them had they lacked writingmasters we should have lacked essayists there are of course certain distinguished people who use this medium from genuine inspiration because it best embodies the soul of their thought but on the other hand there is a very large number who make the fatal pause and the mechanical act of writing is allowed to set the brain in motion which should only be accessible to a higher inspiration the essay then owes its popularity to the fact that its proper use is to express ones personal peculiarities so that under the decent veil of print one can indulge ones egoism to the full you need know nothing of music art or literature to have a certain interest in their productions and the great burden of modern criticism is simply the expression of such individual likes and dislikes the amiable garrulity of the teatable cast into the form of essays if men and women must write let them leave the great mysteries of art and literature unassailed if they told us frankly not of the books that we can all read and the pictures which hang for us all to see but of that single book to which they alone have the key and of that solitary picture whose face is shrouded to all but one gaze if they would write of themselves such writing would have its own permanent value the simple words i was born have somehow a charm beside which all the splendours of romance and fairytale turn to moonshine and tinsel but though it seems thus easy enough to write of ones self it is as we know a feat but seldom accomplished of the multitude of autobiographies that are written one or two alone are what they pretend to be confronted with the terrible spectre of themselves the bravest are inclined to run away or shade their eyes and thus instead of the honest truth which we should all respect we are given timid sideglances in the shape of essays which for the most part fail in the cardinal virtue of sincerity and those who do not sacrifice their beliefs to the turn of a phrase or the glitter of paradox think it beneath the dignity of the printed word to say simply what it means in print they must pretend to an oracular and infallible nature to say simply i have a garden and i will tell you what plants do best in my garden possibly justified its egoism but to say i have no sons though i have six daughters all unmarried but i will tell you how i should have brought up my sons had i had any is not interesting cannot be useful and is a specimen of the amazing and unclothed egoism for which first the art of penmanship and then the invention of essaywriting are responsible street music street musicians are counted a nuisance by the candid dwellers in most london squares and they have taken the trouble to emblazon this terse bit of musical criticism upon a board which bears other regulations for the peace and propriety of the square no artist however pays the least attention to criticism and the artist of the streets is properly scornful of the judgment of the british public it is remarkable that in spite of such discouragement as i have noted enforced on occasion by a british policeman the vagrant musician is if anything on the increase the german band gives a weekly concert as regularly as the queens hall orchestra the italian organ grinders are as faithful to their audience and reappear punctually on the same platform and in addition to these recognised masters every street has an occasional visit from some wandering star the stout teuton and the swarthy italian certainly live on something more substantial than the artistic satisfaction of their own souls and it is therefore probable that the coins which it is beneath the dignity of the true lover of music to throw from the drawingroom window are tendered at the area steps there is an audience in short who is willing to pay for even such crude melody as this music to be successful in a street must be loud before it is beautiful and for this reason brass is the favourite instrument and one may conclude that the street musician who uses his own voice or a violin has a genuine reason for his choice i have seen violinists who were obviously using their instrument to express something in their own hearts as they swayed by the kerb in fleet street and the copper though rags make it acceptable was as it is to all who love their work a perfectly incongruous payment indeed i once followed a disreputable old man who with eyes shut so that he might the better perceive the melodies of his soul literally played himself from kensington to knightsbridge in a trance of musical ecstasy from which a coin would have been a disagreeable awakening it is indeed impossible not to respect any one who has a god like this within them for music that takes possession of the soul so that nakedness and hunger are forgotten must be divine in its nature it is true that the melodies that issued from his labouring violin were in themselves laughable but he certainly was not whatever the accomplishment we must always treat with tenderness the efforts of those who strive honestly to express the music that is in them for the gift of conception is certainly superior to the gift of expression and it is not unreasonable to suppose that the men and women who scrape for the harmonies that never come while the traffic goes thundering by have as great a possession though fated never to impart it as the masters whose facile eloquence enchants thousands to listen there is more than one reason perhaps why the dwellers in squares look upon the street musician as a nuisance his music disturbs the householder at his legitimate employment and the vagrant and unorthodox nature of such a trade irritates a wellordered mind artists of all kinds have invariably been looked on with disfavour especially by english people not solely because of the eccentricities of the artistic temperament but because we have trained ourselves to such perfection of civilisation that expression of any kind has something almost indecent certainly irreticent about it few parents we observe are willing that their sons should become painters or poets or musicians not only for worldly reasons but because in their own hearts they consider that it is unmanly to give expression to the thoughts and emotions which the arts express and which it should be the endeavour of the good citizen to repress art in this way is certainly not encouraged and it is probably easier for an artist than for a member of any other profession to descend to the pavement the artist is not only looked upon with contempt but with a suspicion that has not a little of fear in it he is possessed by a spirit which the ordinary person cannot understand but which is clearly very potent and exercises so great a sway over him that when he hears its voice he must always rise and follow nowadays we are not credulous and though we are not comfortable in the presence of artists we do our best to domesticate them never was such respect paid to the successful artist as there is today and perhaps we may see in this a sign of what many people have foretold and that the gods who went into exile when the first christian altars rose will come back to enjoy their own again many writers have tried to trace these old pagans and have professed to find them in the disguise of animals and in the shelter of faraway woods and mountains but it is not fantastic to suppose that while every one is searching for them they are working their charms in the midst of us and that those strange heathens who do the bidding of no man and are inspired by a voice that is other than human in their ears are not really as other people but are either the very gods themselves or their priests and prophets upon earth certainly i should be inclined to ascribe some such divine origin to musicians at any rate and it is probably some suspicion of this kind that drives us to persecute them as we do for if the stringing together of words which nevertheless may convey some useful information to the mind or the laying on of colours which may represent some tangible object are employments which can be but tolerated at best how are we to regard the man who spends his time in making tunes is not his occupation the least respectable the least useful and necessary of the three it is certain that you can carry away nothing that can be of service to you in your days work from listening to music but a musician is not merely a useful creature to many i believe he is the most dangerous of the whole tribe of artists he is the minister of the wildest of all the gods who has not yet learnt to speak with human voice or to convey to the mind the likeness of human things it is because music incites within us something that is wild and inhuman like itself a spirit that we would willingly stamp out and forget that we are distrustful of musicians and loath to put ourselves under their power to be civilised is to have taken the measure of our own capabilities and to hold them in a perfect state of discipline but one of our gifts has as we conceive so slight a power of beneficence so unmeasured a power of harm that far from cultivating it we have done our best to cripple and stifle it we look upon those who have given up their lives to the service of this god as christians regard the fanatic worshippers of some eastern idol this arises perhaps from an uneasy foreknowledge that when the pagan gods come back the god we have never worshipped will have his revenge upon us it will be the god of music who will breathe madness into our brains crack the walls of our temples and drive us in loathing of our rhythmless lives to dance and circle for ever in obedience to his voice the number of those that declare as though confessing their immunity from some common weakness that they have no ear for music is increasing though such a confession ought to be as serious as the confession that one is colour blind the way in which music is taught and presented by its ministers must to some extent be held answerable for this music is dangerous as we know and those that teach it have not the courage to impart it in its strength from fear of what would happen to the child who should drink so intoxicating a draught the whole of rhythm and harmony have been pressed like dried flowers into the neatly divided scales the tones and semitones of the pianoforte the safest and easiest attribute of music its tune is taught but rhythm which is its soul is allowed to escape like the winged creature it is thus educated people who have been taught what it is safe for them to know of music are those who oftenest boast of their want of ear and the uneducated whose sense of rhythm has never been divorced or made subsidiary to their sense of tune are those who cherish the greatest love of music and are oftenest heard producing it it may be indeed that the sense of rhythm is stronger in people whose minds are not elaborately trained to other pursuits as it is true that savages who have none of the arts of civilisation are very sensitive to rhythm before they are awake to music proper the beat of rhythm in the mind is akin to the beat of the pulse in the body and thus though many are deaf to tune hardly any one is so coarsely organised as not to hear the rhythm of its own heart in words and music and movement it is because it is thus inborn in us that we can never silence music any more than we can stop our heart from beating and it is for this reason too that music is so universal and has the strange and illimitable power of a natural force in spite of all that we have done to repress music it has a power over us still whenever we give ourselves up to its sway that no picture however fair or words however stately can approach the strange sight of a room full of civilised people moving in rhythmic motion at the command of a band of musicians is one to which we have grown accustomed but it may be that some day it will suggest the vast possibilities that lie within the power of rhythm and the whole of our life will be revolutionised as it was when man first realised the power of steam the barrelorgan for instance by reason of its crude and emphatic rhythm sets all the legs of the passers by walking in time a band in the centre of the wild discord of cabs and carriages would be more effectual than any policeman not only cabman but horse would find himself constrained to keep time in the dance and to follow whatever measure of trot or canter the trumpets dictated this principle has been in some degree recognised in the army where troops are inspired to march into battle to the rhythm of music and when the sense of rhythm was thoroughly alive in every mind we should if i mistake not notice a great improvement not only in the ordering of all the affairs of daily life but also in the art of writing which is nearly allied to the art of music and is chiefly degenerate because it has forgotten its allegiance we should invent or rather remember the innumerable metres which we have so long outraged and which would restore both prose and poetry to the harmonies that the ancients heard and observed rhythm alone might easily lead to excesses but when the ear possessed its secret tune and harmony would be united with it and those actions which by means of rhythm were performed punctually and in time would now be done with whatever of melody is natural to each conversation for instance would not only obey its proper laws of metre as dictated by our sense of rhythm but would be inspired by charity love and wisdom and illtemper or sarcasm would sound to the bodily ear as terrible discords and false notes we all know that the voices of friends are discordant after listening to beautiful music because they disturb the echo of rhythmic harmony which for the moment makes of life a united and musical whole and it seems probable considering this that there is a music in the air for which we are always straining our ears and which is only partially made audible to us by the transcripts which the great musicians are able to preserve in forests and solitary places an attentive ear can detect something very like a vast pulsation and if our ears were educated we might hear the music also which accompanies this though this is not a human voice it is yet a voice which some part of us can if we let it understand and music perhaps because it is not human is the only thing made by men that can never be mean or ugly if therefore instead of libraries philanthropists would bestow free music upon the poor so that at each street corner the melodies of beethoven and brahms and mozart could be heard it is probable that all crime and quarrelling would soon be unknown and the work of the hand and the thoughts of the mind would flow melodiously in obedience to the laws of music it would then be a crime to account street musicians or any one who interprets the voice of the god as other than a holy man and our lives would pass from dawn to sunset to the sound of music literary geography these two books belong to what is called the pilgrimage series and before undertaking the journey it is worth considering in what spirit we do so we are either pilgrims from sentiment who find something stimulating to the imagination in the fact that thackeray rang this very door bell or that dickens shaved behind that identical window or we are scientific in our pilgrimage and visit the country where a great novelist lived in order to see to what extent he was influenced by his surroundings both motives are often combined and can be legitimately satisfied as for instance in the case of scott or the brontes george meredith or thomas hardy each of these novelists may be said to possess a spiritual sovereignty which no one else can dispute they have made the country theirs because they have so interpreted it as to have given it an ineffaceable shape in our minds so that we know certain parts of scotland of yorkshire of surrey and of dorset as intimately as we know the men and women who have their dwelling there novelists who are thus sensitive to the inspiration of the land are alone able to describe the natives who are in some sense the creatures of the land scotts men and women are scotch miss bronte loves her moors so well that she can draw as no one else can the curious type of human being that they produce and so we may say not only that novelists own a country but that all who dwell in it are their subjects it seems a little incongruous to talk of the thackeray country or the dickens country in this sense for the word calls up a vision of woods and fields and you may read through a great number of these masters works without finding any reason to believe that the whole world is not paved with cobble stones both thackeray and dickens were londoners the country itself comes very seldom into their books and the country man or womanthe characteristic product of the country hardly at all but to say that a man is a londoner implies only that he is not one of the far more definite class of countrymen it does not stamp him as belonging to any recognised type in the case of thackeray any such definition is more than usually absurd he was as mr melville remarks a cosmopolitan with london for a basis he travelled everywhere and it follows that the characters in his books are equally citizens of the world man and not scenery says mr melville was what he strove to portray and it is because he took so vast and various a subject that the only possible scene for a pilgrim in thackerays footsteps is the great world of london and even in london the scene of vanity fair of pendennis of the newcomes it is not easy to decide upon the exact shrine at which we are to offer incense thackeray did not consider the feelings of these devout worshippers and left many of his localities vague whole districts rather than individual streets and houses seem to be his and though we are told that he knew exactly where becky and colonel newcome and pendennis lived the photographs of the authentic houses somehow leave ones imagination cold to imprison these immortals between brick walls strikes one as an unnecessary act of violence they have always tenanted their own houses in our brains and we refuse to let them go elsewhere but there can be no such risk in following thackeray himself from one house to another and we may perhaps find that it adds to our knowledge of him and of his books to see where he lived when he was writing them and what surroundings met his eye but here again we must select charterhouse and the temple jermyn street and young street kensington are the genuine thackeray country which seems to echo not only his presence but his spirit these are the places that he has interpreted as well as pictured but it needs either a boundless imagination or a mind that holds sacred the boots and umbrellas of the great to follow thackeray with unflagging interest in his journeyings to ireland to america and to all parts of the continent and at onslow square brompton the most devoted pilgrim might find it difficult to bend the knee we do less violence to the truth if in our love of classification we describe dickens as a cockney we might draw a very distinct line round london even round certain districts of london if we wished to circumscribe his kingdom it is true that the late mr kitton who brought what we must consider a superfluous zeal and a too minute knowledge to the task begins his book with two or three pictures of portsmouth and chatham we are asked to imagine the child dickens as he looked at the stars from the upper window of st marys place and we are assured that he enjoyed many a ramble with his sister and nurse in the fields near chatham the imagination oppressed with these details has to bear an altogether insupportable load before it has followed dickens to his last resting place mr melville was wise enough to ignore the hundred and one places of minor importance in writing of thackeray and select only those that seemed to him of primary interest from which the reader will probably make a further selection but mr kitton whose mind was a unique storehouse of facts about dickens lets us have the full benefit of his curiously minute scolarship he knows not only every house where dickens lived but every lodging that he took for a month or two in the summer he tells us how dickens seemed to prefer houses having semicircular frontages and describes the inns where dickens lodged and the mugs from which he is said to have drunk and the stiff wooden chair in which he sat a pilgrimage if one followed this guide would be a very serious undertaking and we doubt whether the pilgrim at the end would know very much more about dickens and his writings than he did at the beginning the most vivid and valuable part of the book is that which describes the various dwelling places of dickens as a young man before he was famous and could afford a frightfully firstclass family mansion as he calls it it was while he lived in these dreary and dingy back streets in camden town and the neighbourhood of the debtors prison that dickens absorbed the view of life which he was afterwards to reproduce so brilliantly these early experiences indeed read like the first sketch for david copperfield no one probably has ever known his london so intimately as dickens did or has painted the life of the streets with such firsthand knowledge he was not really happy when he was alone he made one or two conscientious expeditions into the country in search of local colour but when it had yielded the words he wanted he had no further use for it he spent his summer holidays at various seaside resorts and in london he lived in a variety of houses which leave no single impression upon the mind indeed the book is such an accumulation of detail that it is after all from his own writings that one must draw ones impression of the dickens country and perhaps when everything is said this is always bound to be the case a writers country is a territory within his own brain and we run the risk of disillusionment if we try to turn such phantom cities into tangible brick and mortar we know our way there without signposts or policemen and we can greet the passersby without need of introduction no city indeed is so real as this that we make for ourselves and people to our liking and to insist that it has any counterpart in the cities of the earth is to rob it of half its charm in the same way too the great dead come to each of us in their own guise and their image is more palpable and enduring than any shapes of flesh and blood of all books therefore the books that try to impress upon the mind the fact that great men were once alive because they lived in this house or in that are those that seem to have least reason for their being for thackeray and dickens having done with earthly houses live most certainly in our brains if the thing must be done however we could not wish it better done than it is by mr melville mr kitton from the reasons we have given seems to us to fail and to injure the master whom he would honour both books are full of excellent pictures to one of which only we wish to take exception surely mr melville could have found some happier portrait of thackeray than the etching in dry point by g barnett smith which forms the frontispiece of his book and which gives a singularly inadequate likeness of the grand and familiar head barham of beltana mr w e norris inherits the tradition of anthony trollope and like that master produces his novels punctually and copiously because it is his business in life to do so at this time of day he is not ambitious he is content to reproduce the surface of a certain section of contemporary english life and he tells his simple story without any desire to discuss problems or suggest that everything is not precisely as it ought to be he is the type of writer who regards marriage and the events that precede it as the legitimate end of a novel and when he has satisfactorily disposed of the difficulties that are necessary to make a plot the sound of marriage bells is the signal for a general handshaking and we feel that we can all depart in a state of mild felicity his last novel is not an exception to mr norriss ordinary rule there is a sufficiently elaborate plot which does not harrow our feelings unduly because we know that it will all be happily solved upon the final page mr norris would probably be the first to admit that real life is deficient in plots but he would also quite readily agree that there is no need to take his unpretentious pictures too seriously he has no wish as he says somewhere to discuss motives and analyse emotions and therefore it is necessary for the interest of his story that certain more or less improbable things should happen the plot of barham of beltana for instance would be very surprising if it were true and many modern novelists would think it beneath the dignity of their art to make use of such oldfashioned stage properties but mr norris does not take his art too seriously and is a little amused by the whole business himself his writing is always that of a gentleman quite at his ease and whatever subject he treats he never loses his selfcontrol or says a word more than he means he has piloted too many heroes and heroines through their difficulties to take any very excessive interest in the performance and his sympathies we gather are with the elderly fathers in the background rather than with the sons and daughters who for the moment occupy the stage some of us he says know well enough what is ordinary in human existence and its everrecurring developments but we prefer not to contemplate the normal the monotonous the saddening that clearly represents a middleaged perhaps a prosaic point of view but if it is not profound it is certainly sane and sincere and these are qualities which give all mr norriss work a charm of its own the present novel will not sadden it will not excite but it will provide an hour or two of healthy entertainment and that we imagine is a result with which the author would declare himself content by beach and bogland stories which illustrate the peculiarities of a certain race whether the scotch or the irish have generally an interest of their own and the writer who wishes to preserve this charm finds it most obvious in the poorer classes of the people the peasants who have lived on the same plot of ground for generations and who seem in default of other education to have received some very intimate communication from the land itself are the genuine natives and whoever wishes to understand the history of ireland must decipher these not easily intelligible characters in miss barlow we have an interpreter on whose word we feel we may depend she does not create by force of a great imagination but she writes from firsthand knowledge and gives us a succession of pictures which satisfy partly because they are not ambitious all the stories in this book describe various scenes in the lives of the peasants in faraway irish villages and though the incidents in their lives are rare and unimportant this very monotony has a charm because we feel it to be true the peasant very often spends a lifetime within the radius of his own little village and every pebble and blade of grass is seen as through a microscope the few human beings loom proportionately large if one old lady loses a shilling it is a serious event and the whole population turn out to look for it the importance of shillings in such a world is something that we cannot estimate the lack of them narrows life to its meanest boundaries but to make up for their poverty in all the things that money can buy the sea the bog the moorland have an interest for them that is keener than any merely aesthetic pleasure all this is faithfully painted by miss barlow so that her book keeps a great deal of the charm of the wild and melancholy land and of the people who scrape a scanty living from it the fortunes of farthings the fortunes of fathings by a j dawson has little in common with the average modern novel the point of view throughout strikes one as oldfashioned the characters are of the conventional type of hero and villain and they play their parts with simpleminded consistency the date of the story has perhaps something to do with this it took place in the beginning of the eighteenth century and the scene is laid in dorset in those days apparently the bottle was the inseparable companion of the old english gentleman and the squire who had any pretensions to humanity ended the day beneath the dinnertable the villain kept sober but this is but another proof of the coldness of his heart this sober gentleman was wizened as a forgotten russet apple in spring time his nose was sharp as a ferrets and his sound eye was a grey green gimlet in a pink frame the other was a forbidding blank he is in short everything that an english gentleman of that date ought not to be and his machinations supply the plot of the book mr dawson draws a more pleasant and truthful picture when he describes the life of the country people of the time which he has studied in cosy chimneycorner talk over cider mugs dipped into by venerable cronies among yellow old letters his style which is pleasant and diffuse without being distinguished is more suited to the farm and the simple country life than to the complexities of the human character the picture of dorset of years ago is the most successful part of the book but unfortunately the oneeyed squire contrives for good reasons of his own that our hero shall be kidnapped and carried off on board ship the ship is taken by sallee rovers and the hero finds himself a christian slave in the possession of the sultan of morocco the hardships which he underwent in this capacity and the amazing brutalities of his master fill the last half of the novel mr dawson is a conscientious novelist not only does he give his authority for every instance of the sultans cruelty from contemporary writers but he tells us that before inflicting a certain penance on his hero he tried it on himself but such learning and endurance are quite secondary qualities in a novelist and divert our sympathies from the characters themselves it is perhaps for this reason that we are not deeply interested in the pair of faithful lovers who after going through many painful experiences are happily united at last and enjoy all the good fortune they deserve mr dawson has no very strong grasp of character and he easily lapses into sentimentality and a patriotism which tends to be ridiculous but if the reader wants a long amiable and pleasantly garrulous novel to take to bed with him the fortunes of farthings will serve his purpose nancy stair at the outset of this book the reader is met by a problem which should by this time be familiar whether the story is true as it purports to be biographical dictionaries throw no light on the matter for though there are many earls of stair not one had a daughter who would correspond with the gifted nancy of this volume the poetess and friend of burns however it matters little for the titlepage proclaims the book a novel and the further one reads the more one is convinced that miss maccartney lane has not been studying the dictionaries the story is acted in the last half of the eighteenth century scotland is the scene and thus we are at liberty to be as romantic as we like nancy stair is everything that a heroine ought to be beautiful witty a genius at making verses moreover but it is as a child that we think her most charming when she reminds us not a little of that other brilliant scottish child marjorie fleming she is motherless and her unusual gifts determine her father to give her a mans education in spite of a friends warning that women are not meant to be civilised and that it is useless to attempt it the experiment certainly succeeds in that by the time she grows up the world is at her feet and her poems are famous but unfortunately miss maccartney lane will not let her escape the orthodox doubts as to womans mission which were to become fashionable a hundred years later versemaking had seemed to her the most important thing in the world till she met burns who opened her eyes to the fact that divine genius is consistent with very human failings she realises how little value versemaking holds to the real task of living and understands the real task of living to mean for a woman at any rate marriage and motherhood the genius for poetry seems to be incompatible with the duties of wife and mother and as the least important nancy has no hesitation in quenching it in order to marry and live happily ever afterwards this is the eighteenthcentury solution of the doubts of the nineteenth century such a solution is of course the popular one and it is right perhaps that a novelist should take a sentimental point of view and rejoice at the conventional ending the prosaic mind may be tempted to suggest that the world might perhaps be considerably poorer if the great writers had exchanged their books for children of flesh and blood but miss lane does not go very deeply into these problems and she prefers the romantic to the probable the scheme of the book indeed is too ambitious and in spite of footnotes with ostentatious facts and figures the characters strike us as weak and unreal but if you represent brilliant young women great poets and noble dukes you have need of an imagination to match your daring miss lane fails in this but nevertheless contrives to write a lively and amusing story arrows of fortune the reviewer of mr algernon gissings last book need not spend much time in criticism of his characters their names speak for them sir philip scorton and marian kellbrook are on the face of it hero and heroine crispin cragg is obviously the villain in the first chapter an old book is found in which marians dead father has registered his curse and demand for vengeance upon crispin cragg who has apparently done him great wrong in his lifetime the lawcourts however had decided that crispin was within his rights but marian is a heroic young woman and determines at whatever personal risk to punish the infamous cragg we do not know what precise form her vengeance is to take because at the first hint of her determination crispin has her conveyed to a convenient desert island somewhere near the isle of man where she stays for three weeks concealed in a secret room in a smugglers cottage she is rescued by the knightly youth sir philip scorton who proposes to marry her she cannot consent to spoil his life because she well knows that she must give herself up to the destruction of cragg an alternative is however suggested which shall close the feud that she shall marry hartley the son of cragg this with noble selfsacrifice she consents to do sir philip is fetched from oxford in the nick of time to overhear a conversation behind a rock at solway between marian and hartley and the result is that the three take an evening stroll together sir philip and marian are suddenly seized by rough hands who are in the employment of hartley and would we understand have conveyed marian to bristol for what ultimate destination nobody knew but for the intervention of rhoda grike the widow of the smuggler on the desert island in the scuffle one of the arrows of fortune strikes hartley dead marian is naturally accused of his murder but is acquitted in a scotch court of law crispin has still to be disposed of before the feud can be closed and marian comes to the pacific conclusion to let bygones be bygones crispin is alarmed less the race of cragg should become extinct and proposes to prolong the line by marriage with rhoda grike to this with a meritorious desire for peace she consents on an occasion when the whole party marian and her brother julius crispin and herself seek shelter from a storm in a shed marian in each flash of lightning states that she will not consent to this sacrifice but will end the feud by burning the book herself crispin then most opportunely walks out into the storm where he is struck by the second arrow in the form of a thunderbolt it only remains for julius to marry rhoda and for marian to become engaged to sir philip who by this time was no longer a boy as a year ago he had begun to shave marian and philip make a bonfire in a wood into which they drop the evil book it was as we suspected always concealed about her person where we can only hope that it was burnt to ashes a dark lantern of this novel it can be said without exaggeration that every page interests if such a thing were possible it might almost be added that it is too interesting or perhaps that the interest it excites is not quite of the right quality miss robins has the gift of charging her air with electricity and her readers wait for the expected explosion in a state of high tension this is partly due to the fact that she is always in earnest that she is one of the few novelists who can live in their characters but it is also true that her work would be finer if its intensity were not less but so to speak diffused over a greater surface as it is she is too closely interested in her characters to be able to take a dispassionate view of them a character like that of garth vincent for instance comes near failure because of this tendency to a kind of passionate concentration on the part of the novelist he is one of the many versions of rochester the argument applied once more by miss robins seems to be that if you want a man to be excessively masculine you have only to take certain of the conventional masculine qualities and develop them to the desired strength the result has overpowering effects within the covers of the novel but outside the hero is more melodramatic than impressive in the womans character miss robins shows far more sense of proportion and we protest that if miss katherine dereham had met mr garth vincent under normal conditions she would not have allowed herself to take him seriously a great part of the book is devoted to the medical details of a nervous breakdown and a rest cure in which mr garth vincent is the doctor in attendance here too miss robins seems to have had some purpose in her mind which leads her to insist rather more emphatically than is artistic upon the faults of hospital nurses and the incidents of physical illness the defects of the book seem to us to be the persistent atmosphere of the sickroom of morbidity whether of body or mind and the lack of a sense of humour but there can be no doubt that few living novelists are so genuinely gifted as miss robins or can produce work to match hers for strength and sincerity journeys in spain before going on a journey the question of a guidebook naturally suggests itself your need is not altogether simple and though many profess to supply it few when put to the test are found to succeed baedeker settles your hotel and the amount you are expected to tip the waiter but one suspects baedeker as an art critic the asterisk with which he directs you to the best picture and tells you to a superlative how much praise you must be prepared to expend seems too simple a solution of the difficulties of criticism but though you consult him surreptitiously it is often solely upon him that you come to depend his work as generations of grateful travellers can testify is a necessity though hardly a luxury no one thinks of reading him for pleasure for the reason perhaps that his is the most impersonal of books and even tourists like to be treated as human beings he provides materials in abundance but expects you to draw your own conclusions thus the traveller when he comes to choose finds that guidebooks separate themselves into two classes and neither gives him completely and compactly what he wants books of the type of those that lie before us disclaim if they do not despise the name of guidebook sterne when he invented the title of sentimental journey not only christened but called into existence a class of book which seems to grow more popular the more we travel and the more sentimental we become it is their aim to provide all that baedeker ignores but as their aim is more ambitious so is their success very rarely so complete the sentimental journeys that succeed are among the most delightful books in the language sterne succeeded and so did borrow and kinglake and lord dufferin and mr henry james but the list if we count the competitors is not a long one theirs are books that we may read with almost equal pleasure in the country that they describe or seated a thousand miles away with no prospect of ever seeing the place except with the minds eye they owe their success not to any strangeness in the things they saw or to any adventures they met with on the way but to the faculty of seeing they had in them and of interpreting the sight to others a book such as this is as much a guidebook to the mind of the man that wrote it as it is to any definite region of the earths surface at the same time the balance is kept even the sentiment is not allowed to displace the fact however deeply it colours it the bible in spain for instance gives a clear portrait both of borrow and of spain but it would be hard to say where spain ends and borrow begins such an amalgamation demands rare literary genius and it is no harsh criticism of the writers before us if we say that the secret is not theirs mr thirlmere gives us two substantial volumes of letters of catalonia in which there is considerably more information about mr thirlmere than about catalonia catalonia we gather is a place which like many others possesses sunsets and stars and mosquitoes and cathedrals mr thirlmere has a great deal that is pleasant to say upon all these subjects and they give rise to reflections which lead us in many directions not marked upon the map of spain the sentiment is out of all proportion to the journey it is but fair to say that we are warned beforehand that many changes will be rung on certain subjects such as sunsets rustic wit germany politics and so forth and when he reaches his th page mr thirlmere is genuinely surprised to find how seldom he has found it necessary to allude to catalonia the book then consists of a miscellaneous collection of meditations and facts and personal opinions which conceal any definite outline of catalonia as behind a shifting veil the traveller will still need his murray but the two large volumes though they make no special appeal to travellers can be read with pleasure by anyone who has a taste for light reading of a miscellaneous nature the value of the book is much increased by the many excellent reproductions of pictures and photographs of spain especially of the drawings of mr frank brangwyn mr somerset maughams single volume the land of the blessed virgin is slim and reticent he writes of andalusia and so to speak edits the country carefully he selects certain scenes which have remained in his mind as typical and illustrative of the country which he knows so well and they are not necessarily those prescribed by the guidebook in his work too the personal element preponderates he is content in more than one instance to let an impression stand as a permanent record which was admittedly coloured by facts of purely personal significance but he has his pen well under control and strikes out pictures now and again which are true in themselves and yet could have been so seen by one person only ah the beautiful things which i have seen which other men have not he exclaims and he has a sincere desire to find the right word for the beauty which he genuinely loves and which consequently interests him more than any peculiarities in the individual who observes it his book thus even when the desire is beyond his power of satisfying it has a value of its own both for the traveller and for the reader who remains in his study chair the american woman miss mccracken in her investigations into the natural history of the american woman travelled over nearly the whole of the united states in a journey which occupied six months which she found to be all too short she came home with her boxes full of pamphlets and calendars and her notebooks full of statistics but when she began to write she found it best to put aside all these and to draw her picture from life instead of a scientific treatise on the nature of woman or a bluebook upon her place in the national life she gives us fourteen snapshots of the woman herself as she works or plays in whatever position she happened to be found this method is admittedly superficial but in the space of one short volume we are taken over a great distance of country and shown many queer people living outoftheway lives there are many types of the american woman more perhaps than of the english woman but they have a curious unity we begin with the pioneer who is set down in the western prairie where one need not yet keep to the path for there is none you make your own trail she and her husband have to make their own house their home and their town and the womans work here is even more important than the mans i want to help try new ways says one of these pioneer women who lived in a small cattleranch thirtyfive miles from the nearest town we have our whole lives before us and we intend to make them good the woman in the small town does perhaps the most important work done by women in america america says miss mccracken is a nation of small communities and the influence of home which is the influence of woman is paramount here it is significant that almost all the public libraries in these towns were founded by women their librarians were usually women and the women read almost exclusively real books in the south she found that the women who had suffered most in the war were teaching the negroes and fitting them for public life miss mccracken is a cordial admirer of her own sex and in only one case does her sympathy fail for the last ten years the women of colorado have had the ballot and while she admits that they have done good work publicly by means of it she thinks that it has been at the expense of their own womanliness charitable acts are done with a view to votes and the womans perception of right and wrong has been dulled but it is open to remark that the same might be said as emphatically of the male politician and that the real question is whether the use made by women of political freedom is sufficiently valuable to justify the alleged injury it is characteristic that the american womans club is almost invariably a kind of charity organisation society for the improvement of themselves and others and the democratic motto of one of them of all by all for all is appropriate to many indeed the american view of charity is typical and peculiar a charitable english lady for example may read to the blind in her village but the work is personal and probably ceases in the case of her illness or death an american woman in the same circumstances at once organised a society from the members of her club to help the blind then not content with this she got a commission appointed by the state of massachusetts to inquire into the condition of the blind with the result that the state will probably institute schools for the training of the blind at public expense there are many other illustrations of the same genius for organisation and of the peculiar nature of american charity which is not satisfied with relieving suffering but must find out and if possible eliminate the cause of it we have not space to comment upon the many interesting lines of thought that miss mccracken opens up one remark of hers seems to us to suggest the essential difference between american and other women which gives them their special interest and which has made it possible to paint such a sketch as this of a whole race with marked and recognisable features the province of the american writer she says is the short story because american life lends itself to instantaneous portraiture it is so young without any deep furrows on its face the oldest of us in america are still rather new said one lady who went on to say that they were not old enough yet to be even really democratic a mother can point to her own mother herself and her daughter as representing three stages of development and can lay her finger on the causes which have made them different so many causes have combined to make an englishwoman that it is impossible to trace their effects and the succession of influences may well have neutralised each other but everything that alters her own or her countrys life at present tells upon the american woman and to watch the process is a study of exceeding interest rose of lone farm miss hayden it is clear knows the country and loves it something of its charm at any rate is reproduced in these pages and also something of the oddity of the life of the country people she is not so sure of herself when she treats of the hero and heroine who are drawn tamely after the conventional pattern miss haydens gift seems to lie in close and humorous observation of the details of life on a country farm the character of the fogger esau for instance is the most faithful bit of work in the book but she is trammelled by the limitations of the novel form and is at her best when she describes what she has seen and forgets the necessity of telling a story the story in this case serves merely as an excuse for introducing us to a circle of south country farms where we are mildly entertained by the gossip of the farmers wife and the blunders of the good lady who tries to use dixshonry words the tendency here is perhaps to exaggerate these peculiarities at the expense of the truth and if we look to the proportions of the book as a whole we must complain that many of the scenes are too obviously given as specimens of country manners without connection with the main theme but these little pictures have a certain value of their own which the more ambitious scenes are without an andalusian inn hotelkeepers are apparently subject to that slight and amiable obliquity of the moral sense which goes by the name of loyalty thus when we asked whether we should find good quarters for a nights rest at a certain little country town in andalusia where we had to sleep we were assured that the hotel there was good not of course a firstclass establishment such as the palatial building in which we stood but nevertheless a good secondclass inn where we should be made comfortable and provided with beds of the cleanest at half past nine then when after a long days loitering through the country the train finally came to a stop and announced its intention of going no further the hotelkeepers word sounded comfortable in our ears we should be content with little we reflected and during the last stages of the journey as the orthodox dinner hour passed uncelebrated and the wick which swam in the oillamp committed suicide and its life had not been happy we dwelt much upon the terms of this recommendation and the good secondclass inn became an epitome of all that is desirable in life here we should meet with a simplehearted welcome we pictured the innkeeper and his wife coming out to greet us eager to take our bundles and our wraps bustling about to prepare our rooms and catch the fowl who was to make our dinner for the nights rest between clean and scented sheets the plain but delicious dinner and the excellent breakfast before our early start they would ask some ridiculously small sum we should be made to feel that silver is a most vulgar coin in which to pay such hospitality and that that noble virtue long dead among the innkeepers of our own country still flourishes in spain in thoughts like these we passed the time till the train had reached the station where we were to be rewarded for all our joltings and fatigues it was a little disconcerting to find that the porters at any rate were evidently surprised that two travellers with heavy luggage should be deposited on the platform at this time of night the inevitable crowd came running to stare at us and gaped when we produced the careful arrangement of spanish words in which we signified our desire for an inn a sentence in a conversationbook is something of the nature of an extinct monster in a museum only the specially initiated can tell you that it is related to the live animal it was at once obvious that our specimen was hopelessly extinct and further a terrible doubt insinuated itself that it was the nature of what we asked as much as the language in which we asked it that was unintelligible at length after much spanish french and english had clashed unprofitably it dawned upon the natives that we did not speak their language and the powers of gesticulation were tried upon us presently an official appeared who informed us that he could speak french our request for an hotel was joyfully translated into that language the train goes no further tonight answered the interpreter we know that and therefore we wish to sleep here we said tomorrow morning at but tonight an hotel we insisted the gentleman who spoke french produced a pencil with an air of resignation and wrote large and very black the figures and we shrugged our shoulders and vociferated hotel first in french and then in three different kinds of spanish the crowd had by this time made a complete circle round us and every one was translating for the benefit of his neighbour we then bethought us of a spanish dictionary which had consistently refused to be left behind and the spanish equivalent for the english word hotel was found and emphasised with a forefinger as many heads as could be pressed together gazed blankly at the spot thus indicated and the interpreter was struck by a brilliant idea he lost the place and searched feverishly for a word of his own among the ss and the zs we helped him to the spanish department of the dictionary and left him to prolonged but as it turned out fruitless researches meanwhile we repeated our solitary word in the chance that it might somewhere fall upon fertile soil at every utterance a buzz of good spanish rose from the crowd finally when we were trying to define hotel with an umbrella a small old man forced himself upon our notice to the inevitable question he answered by laying his hand upon his breast and bowing profoundly we asked him three times in succession and he always answered in the same way as though in his solitaryperson he combined all the qualities we needed public opinion seemed to be unanimous that we should accept him as the representative of dinner and bed and a few last attempts at the spanish for inn were answered by hands stretched in his direction to settle the matter he gripped us by the arm and drew us outside the station to the edge of a sandy desert grown with tufts of reeds and lighted by a large moon on one side was a steep hill crowned by a moorish castle and at a little distance we saw a solitary cottage the choice apparently lay between the two and neither seemed precisely what we had expected we looked at the old man and observed not without relief that he was both old and small one of our doubts at any rate was soon at an end for it was clear that the white cottage was to be our lodging and that the hotelkeeper at granada had had the imagination of an artist we were shown into a room where a lamp burnt and where several men and women sat round a fire drinking and talking there was a pause in which several eyes inspected us at their leisure and we were led into an anteroom in whose honour that word hotel had been applied to the cottage there was a bed and a canvas partition to serve as door water to wash in if we chose to keep up that respectable farce and a candle in case we wished for light food to violet dickinson in early january vw refers to little articles one on christchurch the other on the forest which ive tried to make good and careful i vw letters no the article on the forest does not appear to have been published the letters of jane welsh carlyle there is happily no longer any temptation for the reader of these letters to use them merely as so much material for a brief on one side or another of a very unpleasant dispute mrs carlyles letters must rapidly lose if they have not already lost the interest which they had for a generation that had seen carlyle in the flesh and had the morbid appetite of contemporaries for personal gossip these seem to me about the cleverest letters i ever read wrote carlyle and although other issues for the moment obscured that verdict a later generation finds it sound few people indeed have been able to cast so brilliant an image of themselves upon paper and yet it is noteworthy that she has not taken advantage of the usual method of selfportraiture that recommends itself to letterwriters she seldom talks of herself as other than an active and practical human being letters of the inner woman sort all about feelings anything that savoured of selfanalysis or introspection she checked ruthlessly but in spite of this reserve which drove her to make her letters out of facts they were facts which did more to illuminate herself than most peoples feelings she could not go for a drive or meet a neighbour without bringing back two or three precious words of description her letters for example are full of coterie speech little phrases which she has picked up for something odd in the expression or for something characteristic of the speaker in them as a connoisseur with a fine eye might collect curiosities this though it was done so swiftly and faultlessly demands an insight into character and a power of seizing on the essential which is creative as well as critical and in her amounted to genius it meant that out of all the talk she heard and all the sights she saw she could infallibly select the one word or scene which written down brings the spirit of the past before us she made no claim to style in the modern sense of the word but if a manner of speech which is perfectly expressive of the thought and of the thinker deserves such a title she never wrote six lines without it quotation is difficult because she seldom concentrated her wit into flashes though it plays everywhere abundantly and is often brilliant but such coruscations as we find in the letters of charles lamb for instance are seldom spontaneous and mrs carlyle wrote as easily and copiously as she talked she was in all things a practical woman and would have despised a letter which was not content with its simple mission carlyle was writing for his biographer she supposed when he sent her descriptions of scenery instead of some humbler but more necessary details her own letters are emphatically genuine letters in the sense that she had always some definite object in writing them at a particular moment to a particular person thus though she read widely and was educated beyond the standard of her time she seldom writes a word of literary criticism she was content to make her letters out of simple things the fact that she had a higher ambition made her always ironically alive to the smallness of mere letterwriting but if there were such a branch of learning as the study of human nature mrs carlyle would have been one of its most distinguished professors while her husband sat upstairs in the soundproof room deciphering the motives and characters of the actors in some longforgotten drama mrs carlyle was practising the same art over her teacups occasionally the live bodies were treated a little too much as though they were dried inscriptions on parchment who might be made to yield an amusing sentence in the next letter her dark eyes had a dangerous light in them as mr froude says and her wit we gather generally had its victim but this power of sarcasm and of administering a shrewing of which we hear so much was in some degree a measure of protection she was very sensitive and had an inner woman to defend she had constant reason too to recover her balance in the emotions of life with a man of genius by some strong possibly caustic effort of common sense this world looks always the more absurd to me the longer i live in it was a reflection that was often at the back of her mind and that was called forth particularly by anything exaggerated or insincere the style which suits me best is the natural and simple style and my soul cannot be thrown into deliquium by any hundred horsepower of upholstery or of moral sublime thus she was a harsh critic of the class who have most time to deal in superlatives and was merciless to bores but her bores were bores by reason of some pretentiousness or pomposity simple stupidity did not sharpen her tongue though she might note its symptoms with amusement on the other hand there is ample proof that she could be the most faithful and sympathetic of friends where her sympathy was genuinely needed take for instance a scene from her notebook in the first volume of the letters and memorials which is typical of many she has visits from count dorsay and lord jeffrey the prince of dandies and the prince of critics and sketches brilliant little pictures of both then she goes on to ask why does every miserable man and woman of my acquaintance come to me with his and her woes as if i had no woes of my own nothing in the world to do but to console others here has been that illfated cj then she goes out of doors and finds in the kings road a child of the lower orders in the act it seemed of dissolving all away in tears she takes the child back with her to cheyne row to wait investigations and finds a note from a lady who feels it due to herself to make some disclosures to me it was a desperate interview the disclosures end in tears and embraces also in some advice she will not of course follow a syllable of it the child meanwhile munched away unconscious in the tragic scene drowning its recent sorrows in bread and butter mrs carlyle like the true humorist she was has eyes for all sides of the little dramas that enact themselves in her drawingroom and never loses her sense of proportion to the poor the sick the unhappy to any one who depended on her mrs carlyle could show the deeper and more tender side of her character she did not want for dependents humble people for the most part who would not appreciate her wit but the basis of her wit as they knew well was a substantial common sense a power of seeing things as they are which gave the sting to her words and at the same time made her effective in all practical ways she had the same attraction for mad people or miserable people she writes that amber has for straws she could sympathise but her sympathy never blinded her to the facts of the case or made her lower her own high standard some one declared her to be a cross betwixt john knox and a gipsy and the austere preacher in her was not slow to denounce any sumptuosity or indolence that came in her way oh dear me i wonder why so many people wish for high position and great wealth when it merely emancipates them from all the practical difficulties which might teach them the facts of things and sympathy with their fellowcreatures i could not be other than perfectly miserable in idleness world without end thus when she had to give up her ambition to work with her pen she worked none the less hard though in humbler ways her practical difficulties were some of them sordid enough but she made them yield the very best that was in them her battles with crowing cocks and barking dogs barrelorgans and household repairs are grotesque enough in themselves but as she writes of them they become a real significance the facts of things might be found in unexpected places she might sometimes resent the fate which had driven her to squander all her gifts on such apparently trivial ends the eternal writing of little unavoidable notes and the rest but that is not a reflection that will occur to her readers under other conditions she might have written more she could hardly have written better the value of laughter the old idea was that comedy represented the failings of human nature and that tragedy pictured men as greater than they are to paint them truly one must it seems strike a mean between the two and the result is something too serious to be comic too imperfect to be tragic and this we may call humour humour we have been told is denied to women they may be tragic or comic but the particular blend which makes a humorist is to be found only in men but experiments are dangerous things and in trying to attain the humorists point of view in balancing himself on that pinnacle which is denied his sisters the male gymnast not infrequently topples over ignominiously on to the other side and either plunges headlong into buffoonery or else descends to the hard ground of serious commonplace where to do him justice he is entirely at his ease it may be that tragedy a necessary ingredient is not so common as it was in the time of shakespeare and therefore the present age has had to provide a decorous substitute which dispenses with blood and daggers and looks its best in a chimneypot hat and long frockcoat this we may call the spirit of solemnity and if spirits have a gender there is no doubt that it is masculine now comedy is of the sex of the graces and the muses and when this solemn gentleman advances to offer his compliments she looks and laughs and looks again till irresistible laughter comes over her and she flies to hide her merriment in the bosoms of her sisters thus humour very rarely comes into the world and comedy has a hard fight for it pure laughter such as we hear on the lips of children and silly women is in disrepute it is held to be the voice of folly and frivolity inspired neither by knowledge nor emotion it gives no message conveys no information it is an inarticulate utterance like the bark of a dog or the bleat of sheep and it is beneath the dignity of a race that has made itself a language to express itself thus but there are some things that are beyond words and not beneath them and laughter is one of these for laughter is the one sound inarticulate though it be that no animal can produce if the dog on the hearthrug groans in pain or barks for joy we recognise his meaning and it has nothing strange in it but suppose he were to laugh suppose that when you came into the room he did not express his legitimate joy at the sight of you by tail or tongue but burst into peals of laughter grinned shook his sides and showed all the usual signs of extreme amusement your feeling then would be one of shrinking and horror as though a human voice had spoken from a beasts mouth nor can we imagine that beings in a higher state than ourselves laugh laughter seems to belong essentially and exclusively to men and women laughter is the expression of the comic spirit within us and the comic spirit concerns itself with oddities and eccentricities and deviations from the recognised pattern it makes its comment in the sudden and spontaneous laugh which comes we hardly know why and we cannot tell when if we took time to think to analyse this impression that the comic spirit registers we should find doubtless that what is superficially comic is fundamentally tragic and while the smile was on our lips the water would stand in our eyes this the words are bunyans has been accepted as a definition of humour but the laughter of comedy has no burden of tears at the same time though its office is comparatively slight compared with that of true humour the value of laughter in life and in art cannot be overrated humour is of the heights the rarest minds alone can climb the pinnacle whence the whole of life can be viewed as in a panorama but comedy walks the highways and reflects the trivial and accidental the venial faults and peculiarities of all who pass in its bright little mirror laughter more than anything else preserves our sense of proportion it is for ever reminding us that we are but human that no man is quite a hero or entirely a villain directly we forget to laugh we see things out of proportion and lose our sense of reality dogs mercifully cannot laugh because if they could they would realise the terrible limitations of being a dog men and women are just high enough in the scale of civilisation to be intrusted with the power of knowing their own failings and have been granted the gift of laughing at them but we are in danger of losing this precious privilege or of crushing it out of our breasts by a mass of crude and ponderous knowledge to be able to laugh at a person you must to begin with be able to see him as he is all his cloak of wealth and rank and learning so far as it is a superficial accumulation must not blunt the keen blade of the comic spirit which probes to the quick it is a commonplace that children have a surer power of knowing men for what they are than grown people and i believe that the verdict that women pass upon character will not be revoked at the day of judgment women and children then are the chief ministers of the comic spirit because their eyes are not clouded with learning nor are their brains choked with the theories of books so that men and things still preserve their original sharp outlines all the hideous excrescences that have overgrown our modern life the pomps and conventions and dreary solemnities dread nothing so much as the flash of laughter which like lightning shrivels them up and leaves the bones bare it is because their laughter possesses this quality that children are feared by people who are conscious of affectations and unrealities and it is probably for this reason that women are looked upon with such disfavour in the learned professions the danger is that they may laugh like the child in hans andersen who said that the king went naked when his elders worshipped the splendid raiment that did not exist in art as in life all the worst blunders arise from a lack of proportion and the tendency of both is to be overemphatically serious our great writers blossom in purple and roll in magnificent periods our lesser writers multiply their adjectives and luxuriate in the sentimentalism which in a lower class produces the sensational placard and the melodrama we go to funerals and to sickbeds far more willingly than to marriages and festivals and we cannot rid our minds of the belief that there is something virtuous in tears and that black is the most becoming habit there is nothing indeed so difficult as laughter but no quality is more valuable it is a knife that both prunes and trains and gives symmetry and sincerity to our acts and to the spoken and the written word their passing hour a witty woman says george meredith is a treasure a witty beauty is a power the volume before us gives us ample reason to ponder this saying and goes to prove that there were at least eight separate instances in which it once held good it is melancholy to be forced to change the present tense to the past and to confess that we can no longer proclaim ourselves the subject of that sway no beauty it seems is too great to perish no wit long outlives the echo of the voice that speaks it mr fyvies eight chapters indeed are responsible for some sombre reflections we cannot doubt that the power of which they speak was real enough in its day and that these ladies wielded it for the most part in circumstances of truly regal splendour the fact then is all the more strange that when we come some fifty years or so later to ask in what the secret of their rule consisted we must confess ourselves not a little puzzled to account for it she was splendidly handsome we read she had rich colouring and blueblack braids of hair the memoirs and the diaries seldom achieve any portrait that is more striking than that or she was extremely epigrammatic in her talk we are told when we ask for a specimen of the famous wit there is also considerable difference of opinion the same lady is at once an enthusiastic angel from heaven and if we look at her from another point of view bold forward coarse assuming and vain you must reconcile both these extremes before you can make any likeness of the woman who captivated nelson the paradox has challenged considerable and distinguished attention four at least of the eight famous women who are sketched here have had their champions and their enemies more than one has snatched her fame at the cost of her reputation all have thrown down their gauntlets to the world in one way or another but the problem still fascinates partly perhaps because the solution must always escape us the secret of the spell seems to have died in each case with its possessor it could not be transmitted to another that fatal condition was attached to it but the effect was all the more concentrated because it could not be prolonged if it survives the grave at all it is as some phantom and elusive willothewisp which flits through the vague regions of victorian memoirwriters and leaves us with empty hands when we try to grasp it such a book as this spurs us on to the pursuit once more by its sober recapitulation of the miracles that were accomplished by some such intangible force the means seem so slight in proportion to the results which they achieve that we are forced to imagine the presence of some subtle quality which is now lost to us at the same time when we are inclined in sheer despair to belittle the miracle we must remember that we have substantial proofs before us we find for instance that enigmatic lady mrs fitzherbert the daughter of a small country squire winning for herself a power second only to that of the queen and there is the blacksmiths daughter who without manners or wit could rule our greatest admiral and command the fleet the book supplies us with not a few instances of the kind this apparent discrepancy between her powers and her fame may become merely pathetic when we are in a position to test the ladys gifts by some authentic product that remains to us we have the essay on the genius and writings of shakespeare for example if we wish to inquiry into mrs montagus title to fame but it is charitable to remember before we form our verdict that johnson said of the author she diffuses more knowledge in her conversation than any woman i know or indeed almost any man the book we must suppose in this case as in many others is no adequate substitute for the talk mrs lennox on the other hand survives if she survives at all by virtue of the female quixote or the adventures of arabella which we take mr fyvies word for it is unquestionably a work of genius the poor lady might have succeeded better with a witty tongue she lived in poverty and a friend had to pay the expenses of her burial we must not it is plain turn to the ladies literary works to help us to account for their celebrity the pen in two cases at least was merely a useful drudge driven late into the night by beautiful women who must unfortunately earn their bread lady blessington and mrs norton both contributed copiously to these keepsakes and books of beauty in which rank and fashion might use their brains without demeaning themselves mrs norton was styled on a famous occasion the empress of fictioni her novels had enormous vogue and now save for one or two of her poems which have been rescued by the anthologists the rubbishheaps of tarnished finery remain undisturbed it was as we have noted the nature of these womens genius that it seemed inseparable from the living voice and the smile of the lips it evaded the grosser interpretation of pen or pencil we must look for our portrait then not so much in any substantial token that has been left us as in the reflection of the splendour which we can still discover on the face of contemporary society we catch our best glimpse of lady blessington in those remarkable parties at gore house in the youth of the last century when all the lions of the season were collected round her she made an art of such entertainments and believed that they could yield really important results mrs grote too held a salon of the same kind london society it seems was then of such proportions that the different sets could be made to revolve round some appropriate drawingroom centre and women of high natural gifts thought it no mean ambition to occupy the position of authority it asked no small artistic genius they might have claimed though their work must be anonymous lady eastlake again was not only a hostess of great conversational powers but an art critic of high reputation her criticism of john ruskin for instance makes very good reading still and would be accepted with little alteration we believe by the artist of the present day there is happily no need for us to construct for ourselves any laborious portrait of the most brilliant of these eight women the hon mrs norton we need not attempt to put flesh on such bare bones as are thrown to us by contemporary observers when we have diana of the crossways upon our shelves mr meredith as we know desires his work to be read as fiction but the word fiction applies only to the unessential facts and it is safe to predict that generations to come will read the truth of this famous woman and of many like her in the pages of a novel genius alone can preserve for us the wit that has been spoken and the beauty that has long faded by creating them afresh we must be grateful however for mr fyvies addition to our materials although we still await the wizard who shall transform them into flesh and blood thanks must be given too for eight very interesting illustrations the letter killeth it is almost inevitable that the story of a religious phase in its moment of crisis should sound unreal and somewhat distasteful to a generation far outside its influence and it needs rare skill to interpret the religious fanatic so that he is sympathetic to those who do not share his enthusiasm the subtler marks of character seem to be obliterated by the one mastering passion and the novel which has such persons for its chief figures tends unless it can infect the reader with its own fervour to become a little flat and monotonous such a criticism seems to apply to the letter killeth by a c inchbold which gives a picture of the early days of the wesleyan revival on the coast of sussex for in spite of the fact that the author writes well and can give us an interesting study of the effect of the sudden stimulus upon the illiterate peasants the main characters are coldly conceived and have little likeness to palpable human beings a sense of humour unfortunately is no necessary part of excellence and the tension of strict virtue is but seldom relaxed the famous preacher george gilbert and his son are not much more than lay figures upon which the conventional virtues hang stiffly enough and though the character of naomi the visionary enthusiast is drawn with greater delicacy the actors seem for the most part to live in a rarefied atmosphere among shadows the minor characters are drawn with greater freedom and force and provide some welcome relief the plot hinges upon the inevitable conflict between the fleshly and the spiritual loves which must be combined harmoniously before the nature even of a wesleyan minister can be considered perfect the means by which this result is reached are of the ordinary kind and the author does not attempt to penetrate beneath a somewhat elementary conception of character within these modest limits the book is simply written and pleasantly free from exaggeration lone marie the novelreader who sees the familiar name of mr w e norris upon the titlepage can dismiss all doubts as to the quality of his entertainment no problems will perplex him no tragedies will disturb his peace and if the serenity of the atmosphere tends at times to become a trifle soporific few will be so unreasonable as to complain of boredom indeed it sometimes puzzles the reader to decide why it is that with so many rare and indisputable gifts for his calling mr norris has never achieved any work of firstrate importance his last novel lone marie once more proves him a master of technique once more we find ourselves perpetually surprised by some felicity of expression or subtlety of insight which would seem to hint at the presence of a talent more than ephemeral in value but the depths thus indicated remain unrevealed in the present book the characters so far as they go are suggested with admirable ease and delicacy of touch but the wise reader will ask no more than a suggestion if he does not wish to be disappointed gordon heneage the loveable rascal marie ludlow even mrs strover are all of them excellent studies of their kind mr henry james might have noted them down for future use in some brief sketchbook there is the same economy of incident and restraint of treatment and even a trace of mr jamess marvellous penetration and if the likeness ends there it is not obscured on mr norriss part by any supervening defect the fact is merely that he is ready to stop when mr james is just prepared to begin even so we have every reason to thank mr norris for a delightful and delicate piece of work which if it does not reach the highest standard of contemporary fiction is still further removed from the average level the devils due mr burgin tells us at starting that it is his intention to draw an unrepentant villain and if the reader is fond of villains he will have no reason to complain unfortunately nature is less consistent than novelists would wish her to be and seldom achieves a saint or a villain who is not spoilt for artistic purposes by some taint of vice or virtue it is necessary also if you have drawn one character above lifesize to heighten the others in due proportion so that although mr burgin makes praiseworthy attempts to descend to the level of ordinary life we must confess that they seem strangely unnatural when you have tuned your mind to believe in a deserted wife who follows her husband disguised as a man works in his employment for months haunts the neighbourhood as a disembodied voice and is partly drowned in a cellar beneath the villains dinnertable canadian humour seems more than usually out of place mr burgin has facility of expression and can describe canadian scenery vividly but the picture he draws of life and manners in the village of four corners is we hope and believe imaginary the story might be played on the stage with success but it hardly endures the cold light of print the house of mirth the first pages of this novel make it obvious even if the writers name had not conveyed the information that we have to consider a serious work of fiction it is serious not in the sense that it has any definite purpose to expound but in that the writer has chosen her subject with deliberate foresight and has spared no pains to make her delineation exact the moral may be left to the reader she gives us as we do not remember to have seen it given before a picture of that set in new york society which contains not only all that is wealthiest but also all that for whatever reason is most exclusive the members of the community in which the heroine lily bart is placed are bound together not only by the possession of wealth but also by a certain gift which has its equivalent with us too perhaps a force of negation which eliminated everything beyond their own range of perception however we define them there is no doubt that these affinities as mrs wharton calls them which bring the elect together produce a curiously cold and vicious society we are invited to watch this force at work upon a girl who though by birth a member of the set is partially disqualified by her poverty the story traces her gradual descent how in the first instance she loses money at bridge and has to recoup herself by allowing a friends husband to speculate for her how her name is involved in a scandal her friends desert her and finally the necessary sleepingdraught brings a death which if not sought is at least not unwelcome in outline this is unpleasant in detail it is tragic because though the girl has many of the faults of her surroundings she has a capacity for better things which is never to be exercised there is no doubt that mrs wharton has so illuminated the house of mirth for us that we shall not soon forget it the debtor miss wilkins to use the name with which we are familiar was known originally as the writer of very brief and delightful new england stories they were unpretentious in theme and slight in construction but thanks to the skill and charm of the workmanship they managed to outlive much that was apparently more robust since that time she has surprised us more than once by producing a compact work of fiction which so far as the size is concerned has nothing in common with those eminently short stories of an earlier date her new book the debtor is a substantial volume of some closely printed pages which are all moreover spent upon a single subject but on closer inspection it seems that miss wilkins has not changed her method so greatly as this might lead one to expect the story is placed in one of those american villages which correspond with our english cranford but in this case banbridge the town in question is within range of the lights of new york in reproducing the minute humours of the little place the rivalries and intimacies of its inhabitants miss wilkins is at her best in the midst of this rural innocence and simplicity a southern family of the name of carroll has taken up its lodging arthur carroll the father is a man of good birth and great personal charm who having been cheated of his rights in early youth has since considered himself the creditor of society at large and has no scruples in exacting the debt to banbridge he figures first as a rich man later he fails to meet his bills and in the end he is forced to get a living by dancing as a negro on the stage the descent is slow and illustrated from every possible point of view the characters of the debtor himself of his wife and children of his creditors of any one remotely connected with him are drawn in with a curious elaboration and yet the effect is not wholly successful occasionally we are given a chapter which complete and detached as it is might stand for a short story by itself but these scenes are linked together by pages of close description and unessential detail which should have been transacted silently in the writers brain as it is the novel seems to lack unity and in spite of much subtlety and fine workmanship the effect is that of a succession of disconnected studies of character rather than of a single and wellproportioned whole a flood tide it has been maintained that an interval of sixty years places a novelist at the most satisfactory distance from his characters at closer quarters he is liable to be confused by a multiplicity of detail and if he withdraws too far from his creations they are likely to lack vitality miss mary debenham in placing her story a flood tide some hundred and thirty years back lays herself under certain limitations but she has made use of the corresponding advantages in such a way as to justify her choice indeed for a novelist who desires dramatic situations and richness of colouring rather than psychological subtlety the eighteenth century is incomparably superior to the nineteenth in a flood tide for example we are busied from the first page to the last with the intricacies of two main plots one political and the other private which are further complicated with echoes of the stuart cause and a lavish supply of the usual romantic element a novelist with such extravagant tastes must clearly look to the past to satisfy them it says much for miss debenhams dexterity that she can combine all these different threads not only without confusion but so that they seem to spin themselves naturally from the circumstances of the time of the plot it is not necessary to say more than that it is concerned with the peace of and with a hitherto unpublished conspiracy on the part of the french which was to bring it prematurely to an end the gentlemen charged with this affair contrive to get involved in the family difficulties of an english country squire and the mixture of political and private intrigue results in some sufficiently dramatic situations the incidents indeed are occasionally too closely crowded for comfort but on the whole miss debenham has given us a very spirited picture of the time like most novelists who deal with a period other than their own she lays a little too much emphasis upon the superficial distinctions of custom and manner and is inclined to forget that even in that picturesque age men and women were made of something more substantial than powder as a novel of adventure rather than of character the book is successful and a very good specimen of its class the making of michael the making of michael by mrs fred reynolds is the history of the career of a child who from his infancy showed unmistakable signs of genius in the first chapter he asks an elderly spinster whether she knows what love is he goes on with the same amazing precocity to distinguish between photographs and real pictures and further declares that sound and colour are the two best things in the world later chapters chronicle other remarkable statements and actions until it becomes obvious that he must either die prematurely or develop into one of those surprising geniuses who are not uncommon in novels happily his genius is of such an order that it is essential that he should impart its message and he becomes finally the greatest violinist of his time such a nature as this is not to be judged by ordinary standards and the book therefore which portrays it is scarcely a novel in the sense that it attempts a sober study of life or character the vagueness with which the different persons are described is indicated by the fact that they are seldom endowed with proper names but are dubbed stranger or dreamer or musician as though they were possessed of only one quality apiece the child himself passes through the various stages of existence dawn growth experience and so on each symbolised by some significant event till finally he becomes the man this method if somewhat elementary has the merit of simplicity and the writer who is not concerned with the exact truth may be picturesque where another must be prosaic on the other hand it needs great imaginative force as well as rare powers of language to embody the truth in beautifully coloured symbols mrs reynolds has tried to create a character at once real and ideal he is to be as other boys and yet to typify a pure and inspired genius the result is that he is neither one thing nor the other and in spite of a certain grace of style the picture is too vague to leave other than a shadowy and fantastic impression upon the mind a description of the desert mr watson might echo the delightful claim which another writer of whom we are occasionally reminded put forward on behalf of his book i believe i may truly acknowledge wrote kingslake that from all details of geographical discovery from all historical and scientific illustrations from all useful statistics from all political disquisitions the volume is thoroughly free that is the spirit we believe in which journeys ought to be undertaken as it is certainly the spirit in which many people choose to have them chronicled and yet if we judge by results it must be obvious that few travellers who write share this simple faith a new country to most is simply a sheet of statistics upon which they can decipher the annual returns of rice or tea or tobacco and upon which are inscribed in terms as brief the habits of those whom we call indiscriminately the natives it is much to mr watsons credit that he has not once glanced upon this page but has trusted to his own powers of observation from biskra in southern algeria he travelled to tougourt on the edge of the desert of sahara it is not a great distance on the map nor was his path interrupted by adventures but when the reader has submitted himself to the charm of the narrative he is quite content that it should be uneventful and is only disappointed that it should not be prolonged mr watson is master of a leisurely and graceful style well suited to the spirit of the story and when he chooses he can make it yield little pictures of real beauty the vast desert appears to soothe the mind into a state of philosophic calm and from the serene height of a camels back you behold all things dispassionately and yet with a humorous sense of their incongruities all day the little caravan moves on through the high sea of the desert a troop of horsemen drift past with courteous salutation on their lips or a bride passes in her golden palanquin journeying with her kinsfolk to her husbands village at midday the prayingrugs are stretched on the sand and standing upright or bending till their foreheads touch the ground the arabs pray to allah by nightfall the green line on the horizon is reached and they seek shelter in the oasis as in an open boat upon the rolling desert sea this metaphor of the sea is one that recurs so often that by degrees the two ideas of the desert and the ocean rise and blend spontaneously in the mind the immense solemnity indeed might become monotonous were it not for an artifice by which the sameness of the journey is relieved and by which also the spirit of the south becomes articulate mr watson was attended by two arabs athman the guide and abdullah the owner of the camels athman had negro blood in his veins of which he was deeply ashamed but the mixture of dignity and simplicity which the two different strains produced made him a curiously interesting companion he was a poet and beguiled the way by reciting from the manuscripts which were packed in large quantities about his person he was always gay kind and demonstrative but there were some subjects which he felt too deeply to discuss one of these was his religion once mr watson caught him busied with several superfluous parcels of candles careful questioning revealed the fact that a light was to be offered at each tomb of a marabout that was passed on the journey and the vow was kept faithfully even when the shrine had long been tenanted by jackals with this piety he combined a delightful strain of childlike credulity mr watson tells us that he possessed a beautiful meerschaum pipe carved into the head of a laughing negro for this pipe athman conceived a curious affection and his sympathy was genuine when it was explained to him that the negro had once been white but would become entirely black in the course of continuous smoking one day before this process was complete mr watson found the negros head severed from his body the culprit was athman who had taken this decisive step to rescue the negro from the ignominious fate in store for him tougourt on the edge of the great desert was the goal of the journey and here mr watson hired a house and took up his lodging for some time the expedition so far as we are concerned ends here with the fantastic disappearance of athman for by chance he saw a dancer who as she danced expressed in some mysterious way that voice of the south to which the arab as he had once explained can never be deaf to follow her he left his master and his friends and rode away from tougourt into the desert whether we accept this and much that is like it as fact or fiction there is no doubt that mr watson has managed to convey to us something of the mystery and charm of the strange land where such things happen the brown house and cordelia this volume contains two stories which one may infer to be the work of an immature writer who has not yet mastered the technical difficulties of her profession the first pages of the brown house offer but cold welcome to the tentative reader we are presented with genealogical problems before we can have the least interest in their solution and we are hurried from one fresh character to another with uncomfortable rapidity but when these introductions have been conscientiously performed the author is free to exercise a talent that is both delightful and original the scene is laid in both cases in an english country house and the story concerns itself with the normal lives of its inhabitants and the incidents of the village world around them miss booth has set herself a difficult task for the whole interest of the book depends upon the skill with which the different shades of character can be revealed to achieve this she relies almost entirely upon dialogue and shows herself possessed of a real talent for conceiving talk that is at once natural and characteristic she is at her best in conveying the atmosphere of family life and the delicate distinctions of temperament which a keen and humorous observer is able to detect in it she is scarcely so happy when she has to face some more emphatic situation and is clearly hampered by the intricacies of the necessary plot but it is not rash to expect that she will give us something still better in the future delta that a very dusty little volume dated should blossom in all the fairness of a new edition at this prolific season of the twentieth century seems a somewhat impudent defiance of the laws of nature for it must be owned that mansie wauch was among the least substantial of that ghostly company of the books which are no longer read and yet as piety alone would not be responsible for this resurrection the curious will look further and ask not only who is this mansie wauch of surprising vitality but also whose is the name that stands upon the titlepage david macbeth moir was born of respectable parents at musselburgh in his education was good and his boyhood in no way extraordinary except that besides playing games energetically he also saved his pocketmoney to buy books the result of buying books is often the writing of books and at the age of fifteen poems began to accumulate in his desk while the cheap magazine a local sheet printed some very early works in prose but instead of developing along these orthodox lines moir was early apprenticed to a musselburgh doctor and henceforth medicine was his profession and literature was only a hobby to be indulged when his patients allowed indeed his profession was a very serious matter the death of his father left his mother dependent on him and when in he became the partner of dr brown of musselburgh he was kept so closely at work that he was not free till nine or ten at night his brother who shared a bedroom with him tells us how literature was served when the days task was over after supper a candle was lighted and the work of the desk begun with that loving kindness of heart and tender care for others which many remarked in him moir would first persuade his brother to go to bed often however when the night was far spent the boy woke and saw the candle burning and the figure still bent over the open books and the halfwritten sheets by the light of that midnight candle he wrote the rhyming epistles mock heroic translations from horace parodies and cockney love songs which supplied many magazines till the long and fruitful connection with blackwoods magazine was firmly established but it is probable that among all these miscellaneous occupations moir took most pride as well as pleasure in the serious poetry to which alone he affixed his hieroglyphic delta with a certain frugal grace and charm of their own the farmer felix is a lovable and imaginative man who is incapable of work but who meets bad luck and poverty always with the same pious half humorous acquiescence in the ways of fate och och thats bad but sure it was to be is the bitterest complaint he knows for after all life has so many compensations we hear the familiar voice of the celtic poet issuing not incongruously from his lips we go about working or fretting and we kind of forget all the big things that are happening everywhere about us no matter what we be at the autumn comes at the right minute and the sun keeps on rising later every day and we have frosts and dews and whether we like it or not the hedges wither and burst out again ah its wonderful strange with such a philosophy it is not surprising that the farmer and all connected with him gradually sink deeper and deeper into poverty they are rescued by a son dan the dollar who has emigrated at an early age to america and now returns a rich man is it possible that america will turn the son of a dreaming irishman into a strenuous business man in whom all the characteristic qualities of the anglosaxon are preeminent the boy wants us all to be like himself grand and prosperous but how could that happen in a country like this and with people like ourselves asks felix that is one of the many questions which mr bullock suggests to us he is too fine an artist to press an answer upon us but it is not unlikely that his candour conceals one miss kenny in the redhaired woman deals also with life in the west of ireland and like mr bullock she is always both consciously and unconsciously pointing her finger at the peculiarities of the irish temperament but it is curious to see how differently that temperament appears to two observers presumably of the same nationality we may adjust the two points of view to some extent by considering that while mr bullock scarcely leaves the peasants cottage miss kenny is at home in the landlords great house the two views are opposed but each to some degree supplements the other the t in miss kennys book is miss peggy ocurry daughter and heiress of ocurry of the dunes the offset of a thousand princes and gentlemen of ireland on her fathers side and a dane on her mothers this to begin with is an important distinction she is not of the people who are rooted to the soil on the other hand perhaps as a result of her foreign blood she is conscious in every fibre of her noble irish descent miss kennys peasants so far as we have anything to do with them are of the conventional moonlighter type and in every way her conception of character is more emphatic and less subtle than mr bullocks in place of the delicately natural life of the peasants the ocurrys masquerade with all the properties of an ancient family they talk of their luck apostrophise their ancestors and keep an ancestral corpse embalmed on the top of their tower all this might be scottish as it might be irish the writer seems to have absorbed a strange miscellany of facts legends and theories which she has poured out without any regard to form or coherency why we ask did miss kenny burden herself with the pretence of a plot or the pretence of characters for we are constantly tantalised by signs of an original mind stored with interesting knowledge struggling to express itself in an uncongenial medium a patient reader however will find much that illuminates the irish character in the labyrinths of miss kennys novel a walk by night on an expedition reaching to a certain fold in the coast to the west of st ives known as trevail the autumnal dusk fell before the party had fairly started homewards and indeed the view still solid in the twilight was such as to draw ones silent and steadfast attention there stood out into the sea a solemn procession of great cliffs fronting the night and the atlantic waves with what seemed an almost conscious nobility of purpose as though yet once more they must obey some immemorial command now and again a far lighthouse flashed its golden pathway through the mist and suddenly recalled the harsh shapes of the rocks the sight was sufficient to indicate the lateness of the evening in view of those six or seven miles which must yet be traversed on foot and so vague moreover was the surrounding country that it seemed prudent not to forsake the road in halfanhours time even the white surface beneath us swam like mist and our feet struck somewhat tentatively as though they questioned the ground a figure withdrawing itself some yards wavered for a moment and was then engulfed as though the dark waters of the night had closed over it and the voice sounded like one reaching across great depths it was noticeable that though we walked in close companionship and tried to defy the dark with cheerful argument our voices sounded strange to each other and the most cogent reasoning lacked authority insensibly we glided into such topics as are suitable to sombre and melancholy places in those silences which came too frequently the identity of the figure walking beside one seemed to merge in the night one strode on alone conscious of the pressure of the dark all around conscious too that by degrees resistance to it grew less and less that the body carried forward over the ground was some thing separate from the mind which floated away as though in a swoon the road even had been left behind and we had struck if a word implying definite action can be used of anything as indefinite as our course now became across the fields of the daytime the trackless ocean of the night from time to time it was advisable to test the ground beneath the feet in order that its substance might be proved indisputably both eyes and ears were fast sealed or for the pressure on them was of something intangible had grown numb insensibly so that the apparition of several lights beneath us had to be realised almost with conscious effort could one really see as in the daytime or was this some vision within the brain like those stars which a blow scatters before the eye there they hung floating without anchorage in soft depths of darkness in a valley beneath us for directly that the eye had proved them true the brain woke and constructed a scheme of the world in which to place them there too must be a hill a town beneath it the road winding round as we remembered it a dozen lights can do much to solidify the world the strangest part of our pilgrimage was over for something visible had emerged we had a proof before us moreover we found ourselves upon a road and walked forward more freely there were human beings down here too though they were not as the people of the daytime are suddenly a light burnt close at our side and even as we saw it bearing down upon us a wheel crunched and a man in a cart was lit up before us in a second his lights were out and his wheels were dumb no voice of ours could have reached him again as though scenes were passed swiftly before us and withdrawn we found ourselves in a farmyard where a lantern swung an unsteady disc of light over the huddled shapes of cattle and even discovered parts of our submerged persons the voice of the farmer bidding us goodnight recalled us as though a firm hand had grasped ours to the shores of the world but in two strides the immense flood of darkness and silence was over us again yet once more lights stood beside us as though they had approached with silent steps like the lights of ships passing at sea the lamps that we had seen from the hilltop the village was quiet but not asleep as though it lay wideeyed in tacit conflict with the dark we could distinguish forms leaning against the housewalls men apparently who could not sleep with that weight of night pressing against their windows but must come forth and stretch their arms in it how puny were the rays of the lamp against the immeasurable waves of darkness surging round them a ship at sea is a lonely thing but far lonelier it seemed was this little village anchored to the desolate earth and exposed every night alone to the unfathomed waters of darkness and yet once accustomed to the strange element there was great peace and beauty in it it seemed as though only the phantoms and spirits of substantial things were now abroad clouds floated where the hills had been and the houses were sparks of fire the eye might bathe and refresh itself in the depths of the night without grating upon any harsh outline of reality the earth with its infinity of detail was dissolved into ambiguous space the walls of the house were too narrow the glare of the lamps too fierce for those thus refreshed and made sensitive we were as birds lately winged that have been caught and caged a nineteenthcentury critic canon aingers lectures and essays give rise to some reflections which are only indirectly inspired by the text it is no disparagement to the author to say that we find his volumes of greater interest as a revelation of his point of view than as a criticism of the subjects which he professes to treat his point of view by which we may understand the personal attitude towards literature as distinct from the intellectual was far more clearly marked than his critical gift and this attitude is interesting not only in itself but because as ainger would have been the first to agree it is much less common today than it was yesterday and the nineteenth century is already yesterday canon beeching says with obvious truth that aingers interest in literature was in the main ethical he goes on to attribute this characteristic to the fact that he lived in one of the great ages of creative impulse and the writers of such an age he says are chiefly concerned with ideas but the distinction of the writers of the nineteenth century so far as we are now able to judge them seems to be that the ideas which interested them were roughly speaking ethical rather than aesthetic if for this reason alone then canon ainger seems to us a typical product of the nineteenth century the more so because his individual gift was not of sufficient strength to colour or confuse his faithful reflection of the bent of contemporary thought the reader is driven to some such general criticism of the present collection of essays and lectures by the form of work as well as by its nature the lectures are considerably in the majority and anyone who has had the misfortune to be lectured knows that certain defects are almost inherent in the form the sense has to be adapted to the understanding of the least intelligent among the audience and points must be made far more obvious to the ear than they need be to the eye again as canon beeching points out ainger was ready to make some sacrifice of his style for the sake of the lessons to be taught and the publication of the present volumes has been undertaken partly because in the editors opinion these lessons still need to be enforced here we are reminded that canon ainger possessed a professional bias and we feel inclined to echo the criticism which he anticipated for himself lsermoni propriora these things are properer for a sermon but a man is a clergyman because he upholds certain principles he does not certainly if he is canon ainger don them with his black coat and his shovel hat in his case the bias was innate and unconscious it affects every view upon life or literature that is expressed in these volumes but it is only occasionally that we feel that the lecturer is speaking by virtue of his office however we may account for it the reader of these lectures and essays will have to consider this point of view seriously it is part of the lesson many quotations might be found to illustrate it in his lecture upon the ethical element in shakespeare for instance ainger quotes with approval a saying of coventry patmore to the effect that a good poet must first be a good man byron he says might have written the lines to me the meanest flower that blows can give thoughts that do often lie too deep for tears but if byron had written them they would not have affected our imagination and evoked the kind of response in our hearts as they do when we know that they were written by wordsworth the reason is that we are in fact whatever our theories upon this head affected in our estimate of some beautiful and touching thought by our acquaintance with the personality of the author of it canon ainger goes on of course to point out that we draw our conception of an authors personality from the whole body of his work and not from isolated phrases this estimate would not be altered by any knowledge of the actual facts of his life because the man and his work are indivisible but as it is true that we can judge a mans character from his writings so we can lay emphasis upon that element in his work which reveals his character the ethical element that is in preference to the purely intellectual in the case of shakespeare we have no evidence that affects our estimate of him save that which is supplied by his works but with other writers it is not so it is tempting in many instances to use our knowledge of a mans life to interpret his work and the result may be not only that we lay too great a stress upon the ethical element with which it is allied this we must confess seems to us the weakness inherent in all canon aingers writing his chief aim in criticism seems to be to institute an anxious inquiry into the state of the writers morals shakespeare thus was chiefly superior to marlowe because he had a dominating sense of the supremacy and beauty of goodness mr stephen phillips is not a great poet because the ethical element is absent from his plays tennyson is superior to shelley and keats because his sympathies are in close touch with man his sorrows his hopes his eternal destiny no one will deny that a man may reasonably hold these judgments but no one will feel that they are comprehensive we may even assert that they imply some intellectual confusion the upshot of it is that canon ainger we feel gives undue prominence to moral excellence in literature his literary judgment is swayed by what he knows of a mans life and his affection for a writer blunts his critical insight one might almost sum up his position by the advice which he gives to those who aim at being pleasant in conversation take care of the heart and the intellect will take care of itself such advice as he knew well would be held merely amazing by a generation which is more concerned with the state of its art than with the state of its soul thus he found himself in the position of one who has to teach a lesson he detected grave faults in the new age and he did not hesitate to condemn them but though we cannot agree in the value of the lesson which he consciously sets forth we believe that unconsciously he has taught a lesson well worth learning the picture of the man himself is the best thing in these volumes for though no one will call him a great critic all will agree that he reverenced letters that he possessed a mind of singular culture and sincerity and that his sympathy was with everything both in life and in letters that he held to be sweet and true for these reasons it seems that he had something of that secret of charm which he defined to be the presence of the moral element that is the human element the ear that hears the still sad music of humanity and responds to it after his kind the stories which make this volume all treat of the different aspects of love but mrs henderson has chosen in every instance an unusual point of view she has not tried to elaborate plots or to analyse character rather she has taken up her story at some point of emotional crisis and has dropped it when the crisis is past and the crisis comes where you do not expect it her stories then are very short and in most cases very intense they are even occasionally abrupt we are left standing on the edge of a precipice as it were but however brief and elliptical every story manages somehow to hold the attention often to puzzle it the people are strange their actions are odd their speech is unwonted everything about them is a little harsh and angular but this austerity when it is due to discrimination has a force of its own the story of the italian priest and the madonna of the preacher in the docks of the don and jane austen for example and we could quote others express much more than they say and even when the writer is not so successful she yet interests us by the directness and originality of her touch the book in short stimulates our appetite and we hope that mrs henderson will give us more the sister of frederic the great the sister of frederic sic the great left behind her not only a considerable mass of correspondence but also according to the habit of her age a memoir which she had never been able to finish to her liking after her death the manuscripts fell into the hands of publishers and various editions with different claims to authenticity excited for the time considerable interest and controversy wilhelmina it appeared had used her pen freely some thought unscrupulously and the critics were quick to convict her of disloyalty as a friend and of inaccuracy as a writer nevertheless carlyle with his keen eye for worth finds it a human book a veracious book done with heart and from eyesight and insight to saintebeuve it revealed talents no less remarkable than those of her famous brother miss cuthell although her method is at times too crude and colloquial to be altogether pleasing has given us a picturesque and readable account of a woman who is invariably interesting on her mothers side wilhelmina was a granddaughter of george i of england and of sophia dorothea the prisoner of ahlden her fathers mother was more pleasantly distinguished as the friend of leibnitz and bayle who did her best to kindle something of the brilliancy of parisian salons in charlottenburg the parents of frederic and wilhelmina had done little to deserve two such children and the relationship was from the first strangely incongruous frederic william the father with many solid claims to respect treated his children with a grotesque brutality which suggested insanity sophia dorothea the mother was a stern and ambitious woman who like her husband was too much dominated by her own wishes to have much independent affection for her children wilhelmina was a precocious child but save for one circumstance an unhappy one the happiness of her childhood as to a great extent of her whole life depended upon her brother frederic who was born three years after her they had two bodies and one soul he wrote in later years they were inseparable in the nursery at six years old wilhelmina had impressed the eye of a painter with one attitude that was to be characteristic of her future life she lays her hand on frederics arm to restrain him from some infantine campaign on which he is bent with his big drum but in the nursery wilhelmina had to suffer from the tyranny of nurses and the erudition of scholars the queen was already ambitious for her daughter and not content with the simple teaching of governesses procured a tutor who could instruct in six modern languages without counting slav and basque dialects and oriental tongues including chinese with this gentleman wilhelmina absorbed universal history with such thoroughness that it took her four years of steady toil to reach the eighth century starting from before the deluge she was so good a linguist that as saintebeuve says she might have written her memoirs in english or german had she not chosen to write them in french but unfortunately she was taught neither greek nor latin and with her deep interest in the classics only knew them through translations all this learning however so far as the queen was concerned was but an instrument to fit wilhelmina for marriage her marriage engrossed her thoughts while she was still strumming her scales and learning her declensions for thus early the queen had chosen frederic prince of wales as the most desirable suitor for her daughter to further the match she condescended to intrigues and secret negotiations in which wilhelmina soon became an accomplice for although both mother and daughter ignored the wider issues that were at stake the king considered the english marriage from its political aspect only the part that this intrigue played in wilhelminas early life seems curiously out of proportion to its intrinsic importance or perhaps we may complain that miss cuthell has followed the complications too laboriously after six years of scheming and diplomacy the negotiations were broken off by the king in a sudden fit of rage and before wilhelmina knew what was to become of her the crown princes plot to escape to france was discovered it was natural that wilhelmina should be suspected of complicity and after a violent scene with her father she was sent to prison and bidden to reflect on the merits of her two suitors the duke of weissenfels and the hereditary prince of baireuth sic her mother was still of opinion that a prison is better than a bad marriage but wilhelmina when her brothers pardon was promised on condition of her consent was weak enough to give in she agreed to marry the prince of baireuth and received two letters from her parents in one of which her faithful father promised that he would never forsake her and in the other her mother exclaimed i swear you an eternal hatred and will never forgive you in spite of the fervour of this statement the queen proved herself fairly consistent so far the brutal and cumbersome machinery of the court had effectually obscured the finer shades of wilhelminas character her love of her brother was the most individual trait in her nature except for a habit she had when ill in bed or locked up in prison of reading and writing and composing music but now that she was married she could expand more freely although the atmosphere was still sufficiently harsh the little court of baireuth was humble compared with that of berlin and her royal highness seemed both to herself and others too grand a lady for such simplicity the margrave her fatherinlaw moreover was as economical as her own father and less respectable he might have been induced to die thought frederic if only he was sure that they distilled brandy in heaven but wilhelmina was happy in her husband who to some extent shared her cultivated tastes a daughter their only child was born to them and named frederica after her uncle the margrave died in and with her accession began the few happy years of wilhelminas life as margravine she had some scope for her energies although in many ways they were still pitiably circumscribed her husband consulted her in the affairs of the government and she began to meditate plans for transforming baireuth into a centre or at least a reflection of intellectual brilliancy she corresponded with her brother about italian actors and musicians and the rustic taste of baireuth was trained by the performance of french plays and operas her intellectual tastes were revived and stimulated she read philosophy and expounded her views upon the theory of atoms and the existence of god she began to build extravagantly in the classical style this it is clear was the real wilhelmina the woman of brilliant and volatile intellect eager for knowledge and experience and craving above all the stimulus of companionship she stayed once at rheinsberg when frederic was king and the days passed in music acting and the conversation that she loved there she met voltaire and began an intimacy which lasted her lifetime but the king left this brilliant company for the opening campaign of the war of the austrian succession and henceforward the margravines life was never free from anxiety my great joy she had written has always been study music and above all the delight of society all her life with one or two brief exceptions she was only to know this joy through translations the music and the society of baireuth she found detestable nor was she to enjoy her studies and the companionship of her husband for long wilhelminas beauty faded as her health became increasingly frail and her husband was drawn into an intimacy with her greatest friend dorothea von marwitz wilhelmina in spite of her sarcastic tongue was distinguished by a certain proud loyalty where her friends were concerned and for a long time would see no ill the effect of her disappointment when she could no longer ignore it was to concentrate her affections still more exclusively upon her brother he inspired the most profound feeling in a nature too fastidious to be passionate she threw herself into the intellectual reform of baireuth founded a university and anticipated the present opera house baireuth was sufficiently gay to attract frenchmen from their metropolis voltaire with whom the margravine corresponded paid her the high compliment of coming himself but all this activity was carried on in defiance of the failing health which obliged her to winter in the south to wilhelmina the journey was an intellectual pilgrimage to be performed in a spirit of due reverence but the account so faithfully recorded by miss cuthell is not more interesting than such itineraries generally are wilhelmina at the age of fortyfive preserved an insatiable appetite for the sights of the world the last years of her life were years of physical and mental suffering she tried to negotiate a peace for her brother and failed she had to hear of his defeats and to read of his desire to kill himself medieval barbarism she thought was to engulf the little spot of light and reason which she had tended with so much care her daughters marriage proved a failure but her mind as she wrote in her last letter to her brother is always with me and she might have added always occupied with others she died in october aged fortynine and vanity of vanities was by her own choice the text of her funeral sermon miss cuthells book is full of interesting materials for any one who cares to preach it the scholars daughter the picture of a girl young beautiful and gifted brought up solely among learned scholars who are preparing a colossal dictionary of the english language attracts attention at the outset in the scholars daughter by beatrice harraden but afterwards we complain that the author has been satisfied with the obvious reading of the situation so that its attraction and promise remain on the surface perhaps it is impossible to feel much sympathy for the selfpossessed young woman with her high spirits and her slang or perhaps the scholarly atmosphere with which she contrasts is but a very diluted version of the real thing the three bookworms with their tender hearts and their tempered love of philology are not convincing as men or scholars if as miss harraden would have us we must make that distinction the book indeed seems to fall between two stools either miss harraden might have concentrated her powers upon the sufficiently amusing intricacies of the plot and turned out a wellfilled short story or had she chosen to expound the characters more elaborately she might have given us an interesting study of the conflict of one temperament with another but as it is if we consider the book as a serious novel its superficiality irritates us or if we take it as a short story we are wearied by the protracted explanations if it is said that in spite of this it is easy to read the scholars daughter with interest and amusement it is obvious how much more might have been expected of the writer than she has given us here a supreme moment it is not easy to account for the impression that a supreme moment by mrs hamilton synge leaves upon the mind even during the process of reading one is conscious of a little amazement at the result which is being achieved by apparently simple means a commonplace stretch of english country dotted with substantial country houses and snug vicarages will either be described one expects quite frankly as it stands or made the scene of some violent and romantic contrast but mrs synge starting as it seems to go patiently over the familiar ground of mothers meetings and village scandals somehow contrives always to skip what we expect and to show us something different nothing more happens than that a girl brought up with some freedom abroad comes to stay with a quiet english family but her coming slightly changes the perspective all round the girl herself is not much more than a shadow but she has the property of proving that the characters among whom she passes are living flesh and blood the gradual unfolding of agatha the staid englishwoman of middle age when brought into contact with something unlike what she has ever known is the real achievement of the book for without any crudeness or improbability we are shown the way in which with all the odd reserves and simplicities of her type she alters the point of view which education and tradition have given her thus by the end of the book she has become a new person with hardly any alteration in the facts of her life to accentuate the change which has taken place within mrs hamilton synges method is carefully simple she always understates and often omits what we expect to be put in but in spite of the fact that some of her characters are hints rather than people each stroke makes its impression and the result is that the book as a whole is undeniably memorable among its fellows the house of shadows in many novels the situation seems to have been suggested by the authors desire to introduce certain characters in others the writer seems to have conceived his scheme first and to have made his characters its creatures mr r j farrer in the house of shadows has written a novel under the stress of an idea and although his method has certain drawbacks it has undoubtedly produced a book remarkable for its force and continuity the story is concerned with an old yorkshire house and its squire ladon by name who has nursed his eccentricities and his pride in solitude with an only son since the death of his wife twentyfive years ago the son has never mixed with the world and the first visit that he pays to london sends him back to yorkshire with a wife between this vulgar but beautiful and passionate woman and her morose old fatherinlaw things go wrong from the first indeed in his fierce headaches his dislike of her becomes almost insane then he is suddenly told by a specialist that he is suffering from a disease that must kill him after a year of increasing agony a niece guessing that her symptoms are the same as her uncles poisons herself and he resolves to do the same thing but that his religion forbids suicide his son refuses to administer the draught and he determines to exact this deed in revenge from his daughterinlaw the situation verges upon the melodramatic but the reserve and humour with which it is treated keep it in proper proportions the same purpose that is links all the chapters together and each adds something of its own to the single impression and that impression is so consistently gloomy that it is possible to resent the power with which it is expounded for the writer seems possessed with the idea of physical pain and its conflict with the forces of the human soul with love and religion and it is pain that conquers the drawback of the concentration which is the result of the scheme of the book is naturally that the characters are always seen under some kind of distortion and that at intervals the idea behind comes too prominently and crudely to the foreground the author harangues us on occasion as though he were speaking from the pulpit and the defect that is allied to the subject of the book qualifies our admiration at its strongest the pain and conflict are inevitably degraded by the taint of the merely bodily anguish from which they proceed but these are the limitations of a remarkable book and in some degree spring from its strength moreover pleasure of a less sardonic kind can be taken in cousin coralie the countess the reverend mr lancaster with his devout respect for titles and mrs bolpett of the ancestral bolpetts mr farrer clearly is a writer to be remembered blanche esmead mrs fuller maitland calls her novel blanche esmead a study of diverse temperaments the frail and exquisite blanche esmead has married an honest country parson who can talk only of the clothing club and of the drunkenness of hoggins the diversity however between the parson and his wife manifests itself in such very trivial ways he likes cold beef for instance and his wife cannot bear it that a catastrophe of any kind between them seems quite unnecessary for some reason we do not realise that there is an essential gulf between the two of which these trifles are the superficial indication but then mrs fuller maitland writes so gracefully and evolves her story with such smooth skill that we are content to remain on the surface and laugh at trifles there is no need to take anybody or anything very much to heart good john esmead was no doubt a very worthy man but as he will quote proverbs on every occason call his wife the wifie knock over the ink and tread upon the dog what can we do but laugh at him every village in england must be supplied with such a vicar and such a mrs crowle who cuts out the clothes and manages the societies and is full of intolerance and virtuous wrath if we are to believe the novelists somehow it seems conceivable that the novelists have been satisfied with a traditional conception of these parts and that the pattern may have changed since it was first originated but mrs fuller maitland is quite content with things as they are or may conveniently be supposed to be then there is of course the great lady of the neighbourhood who on this occasion is a lady of doubtful reputation and zephine the fashionable widow from london in whom blanche confides there is a little flavour of the disagreeable some discomfort neuralgia of the soul as blanche calls it but blanche is too refined to be wicked and when the crisis comes prefers to die gracefully of influenza until her good husband somehow suggests to her that a coffin and a grave are necessary parts of death upon which she eats her dinner and recovers it is then obvious that john must collide with a motorcar and so set his wife free in the eye of the law to marry her irreproachable lover basil forde all this naturally is treated in a facile and frivolous style in which pet dogs and paper knives seem of equal value with men and women but within its limits the limits of a fashionable drawingroom this is a graceful and entertaining novel and the action is swift and sparkling from first to last if it is also shallow the face of clay mr h a vachell could hardly have chosen a happier setting for his novel the face of clay than the fishing village of pontaven in brittany the rustic barbarity of the peasant life becomes something primitive and beautiful when it is set against the mysterious background of the sea it is as though the presence of this great force at their doors simplified and lent dignity to the lives which are so constantly risked upon it certainly mr vachell has caught the spirit of the place and conveyed it to us in a quantity of delicate and vivid pictures of the sea and of the characters bred beneath its influence his heroine tephany lane belongs in a double sense to the twofold life of the town and its colony of artists on her mothers side she comes of an old breton family and her father was an english painter who is drowned as the book opens in the sea almost beneath his daughters eyes but it is the breton element in her that predominates and her strong inheritance of breton instincts and superstitions that gives its meaning to the story indeed the first half of the book in which the life of both peasant and artist is illustrated with great charm and an indication of perfect fidelity attracts us more than the development of the story itself michael ossory the painter of genius who leads a life of failure and misanthropy in remorse for a mysterious crime committed early in life is not a figure who convinces one of his truth or impresses one with his supreme capabilities the touch of mystery and superstition which seems natural in a breton peasant becomes slightly melodramatic in the character of an english gentleman for this reason the second half of the book in which the story of the crime symbolised by the face of clay is confessed and cleared up is less successful than the perfectly natural and sincere opening mr vachell is conscious perhaps that he has a moral to expound and he becomes therefore a little solemn and emphatic clinton carne he remarks walks out of these pages a better man than he entered them and a finer artist that may be true but the conclusion ought to have been so closely woven into the texture of the story that there was no need to sum it up in so many words but though there are some weak passages especially it seems in any crisis of emotion the book is interesting not only as a study of curious beliefs and superstitions but in a wider sense as a study of the life that is not limited to peasants the subsidiary characters of mary machin and johnnie keats the delightful satellite are observed with such humour and sympathy that they make a very severe touchstone by which to test the other characters in the book and the story of yannik the peasant girl whose caste forbids her to sit as a model and the grandmother who craves for the fat fivefranc pieces in order to save her sons souls is observed with such delicacy that it touches the reader perhaps more than anything else in the book the poetic drama it is at least encouraging to see with what energy people can still devote themselves to poetry even in its most arduous and ambitious branches no less than three of the seven volumes before us are seriously concerned with the drama and merit our respect therefore however we may rate their achievement mr dillon indeed has given us not only a play but a trilogy a threefold illustration of the life of william the conqueror it is a tremendous theme and the author has attacked it vigorously but his vigour is spasmodic rather than sustained and he never reaches those equable heights to which the masters of blank verse seem to rise without effort thus he can keep up to a fair level of dignity for a passage at a time and then the strain becomes too tense and he drops to a metaphor like this these words are gridirons whereon we lie stretched in lingering agony or this let me gather up the shreds the potsherds of the broken crock my son and the spell is rudely broken but it would be unfair to criticise a work of such magnitude by single phrases the general impression left upon the mind of the reader is somewhat fragmentary and confused as though a great many scenes and characters had passed across the stage without much order or continuity mr spencer moore is more successful in the narrower limits of his aurelian he has used his materials more completely and has the advantage of a skilled and mellifluous pen his gift it is true is more for a picturesque rhetoric than for the imaginative depths of poetry passages like the following abound the sun in golden plashes beats upon my battlemented glory do you not hear the waves of adulation lapping me and that is not poetry but in the mouth of zenobia queen of palmyra the lines are not inappropriate or at any rate we can accept them in default of better mr moore moreover can make his drama move with some swiftness and dramatic skill so that it is not hard to read him even with some degree of pleasure it is curious indeed to hear a roman emperor address his son as sonny and speak of a protege while zenobia adjusting her diadem after her submission asks is it on straight the insight into feminine nature that is shown in the last touch is hardly permissible in a poet who is not euripides but with the exception of a few slips like these the play is vivid and occasionally eloquent with mr douglas fox we draw nearer our own time and the change is welcome for both the dramatists we have passed in review respect the splendid surface of their kings and queens too deeply to credit them with human subtleties mr fox shows traces of a warmer sympathy he takes five scenes from the life of sir thomas more and leaves him on the scaffold with the axe about to fall the drama moves gently and melodiously with no very great vigour but without consistent dignity of thought and expression there are lines too which suggest that he has it in him to produce something more than lengths of irreproachable english as for instance the concluding lines of the fine speech on page rather march with souls attuned to heavenly purposes and fortified by stout fidelity to ancient high and venerable things beneath old banners into lands unknown the figure of dame more is excellent sir thomas himself is a little too flatly and evenly drawn to excite much sympathy miss von herder leaves the solid world and takes us beneath the sea but it must be confessed that her mermaidens and her sea queen in particular would do credit to belgravia and that is a disappointment matthew arnold in his forsaken merman made the sea and its people both true and mysterious but miss von herder makes the fatal mistake of adding a tail to the ordinary mortal and thinking that she has created a mermaid however the tails are an excuse for much pretty and fantastic verse and if the sound and the sense are somewhat thin it is all thoroughly sweet and amiable of mr upsons poemdrama again it is difficult to speak enthusiastically though it would be unjust not to speak respectfully unfortunately it is possible to write a great number of lines in perfect taste and rhythm without saying anything that has not been said before any one with sufficient culture and leisure might be expected to write as mr upson has written with no other or rarer gift from the gods the city in which he has for his theme the story of abgar king of edessa and of his appeal to christ is not so successful as the shorter pieces which succeed it culture is less able to deal with such faroff things than with the gentle meditations inspired by an oxford garden here mr upson is pleasantly at his ease and muses not unmelodiously the claim which mr hookham makes for his book is doubtless justifiable it is the individual expression of an individual mind and no plagiarism either in thought or expression whether the individual mind is so interesting that we wish to have an exact copy of it may be a matter of opinion so long as the poem flows easily among familiar thoughts it is graceful enough but directly the writer has to face a crisis his imaginative force gives out and he takes refuge in the conventional and obvious this is sufficiently clear from the sappho where there are some genuinely graceful passages while in the cup and the lip written in conjunction with mr edward ferris the exigencies of the plot are painfully beyond the strength of the verse indeed we get the impression that the drama was written primarily for the stage and that the authors have not considered how crudely their work reads in the paler light of the study for the rest mr hookham has paraphrased a great number of la fontaines fables and has also written some shorter original pieces these show him to be possessed of a sincere and appreciative mind which reflects thoughtfully upon such themes as spring and age the snowdrop equality and so forth we have left to the last the volume which has given us the clearest impression of original talent miss travers is a young writer who publishes for the first time she is at the stage evidently of revolt and intolerance of question rather than of answer she reads as though she wrote under some sort of compulsion and not merely because words can be made to rhyme in the arcady in peril and the suburbiad she lashes the ugly surface of modern life with satire often pointed but sometimes shrill but in spite of this tendency to see the merely ridiculous side of things perhaps because of it she is equally sensitive to the underlying beauty these shift and pass the unknown powers remain the everlasting voices linger yet by field and flood in other poems notably the enemy within the cliff head the tramp miss travers lets her imagination dwell on subjects that are more congenial to it and proves that she can see clearly passionately and with her own eyes such gifts make this little book noticeable among its fellows for they promise work to come no less original and more deeply imaginative than that which we have in the volume before us poets letters if it were possible to condense into set phrases that mist of felt rather than spoken criticism which hangs round all the great names in literature it is tolerably certain what result we should reach in the case of mrs browning we should have to interpret some brief decision to the effect that she was a bad poet and that our fathers were strangely mistaken when they exalted her to the place which she holds in theory at least at the present day it is true that a candid inquirer would have to enlarge and qualify such a verdict considerably before it could be allowed to stand but in its rude way it points to a fact that need not be made the subject of inquiry here that mrs browning as a poet has ceased to play much part in our lives the appearance of mr lubbocks book however makes one wonder whether the method which he has applied to her letters might not be applied with equally happy results to the voluminous body of her poetry for her letters especially we must own the famous volumes of love letters are responsible for a great deal of our partly instinctive distrust of her poetry it was dreadful the sensitive said to overhear but if one did sin the more callous suggested it was as well to be guilty of a pleasant crime and the eavesdropper became so weary of those emphatic voices protesting and asseverating uttering commonplaces with dreadful distortion of the lips and drowning even the simple emotions in a twisted torrent of language that he might surely consider that his fault was expiated as soon as committed mr lubbock then has done mrs browning and her readers a substantial service with singular discretion and tact he has gone through the many volumes of her correspondence prompting her as it were to speak just those words which explain herself and connecting them with admirably intelligent comments of his own in the compass of one modest volume we have all the passages we could wish to see preserved and when thus skilfully pieced together it is seen that they compose a finished and brilliant portrait of the writer and then it appears how summary would have been that decision which disposed of her merely as an extravagent freak of early victorian taste and denied her any more permanent claim on our attention for paradoxically enough it is more easy to understand what was meant by her genius when we study her life than when we read those works that were the legitimate expression of it it is as though the pure and intense flame which we detect when we read or hear of her had been blown into all kinds of vague and diffuse gusts more of smoke than of fire when she yielded herself in her enthusiastic way to the inspiration of poetry but when we approach her work through a knowledge of her life something of the disappointment is explained although the pity of it is deepened it is one of the merits of mr lubbocks book that the familiar facts of mrs brownings life of her unmarried life in particular are so arranged that they seem to gather a new and significant force in hands less just and discriminating the story becomes so monstrous that its real effect upon mrs browning is obscured but as it is told here with the perpetual illustration of the letters it becomes clearly a thing that did really happen and that had an immense but calculable influence on the victims life we see how gradually after those first years of astonishing precocity elizabeth was silently secluded from the world forced to acquiesce in her position as a lifelong prisoner in a london house guarded by a mad gaoler in the person of her father and nourished almost solely upon books and her own writings without definite disease she was relegated by family consent to a sofa in a single room which she scarcely left for five years it is true that she saw a few visitors who could be smuggled upstairs without meeting her father and she carried on a voluminous correspondence with mild literary gentlemen who were anxious to direct her talent but it was hardly possible as she knew herself that sane poetry should issue from such conditions you she writes to browning seem to have drunken of the cup of life full with the sun shining on it i have lived only inwardly or with sorrow for a strong emotion before this seclusion of my illness i was secluded still and there are few of the youngest women in the world who have not seen more heard more known more of society than i who am scarcely to be called young now when she was supposed to be dying she thought that i had stood blind in this temple i was about to leave that i had seen no human nature that my brothers and sisters of the earth were names to me that i had beheld no great mountain or river nothing in fact and do you also know what a disadvantage this ignorance is to my art that i am in a manner as a blind poet certainly there is a compensation to a degree i have had much of the inner life and from the habit of selfconsciousness and selfanalysis i make great guesses at human nature in the main but how willingly i would as a poet exchange some of this lumbering ponderous helpless knowledge of books for some experience of life and man for some m the vigour with which she threw herself into the only life that was free to her and lived so steadily and strongly in her books that her days were full of purpose and character would be pathetic did it not impress us with the strength that underlay her ardent and sometimes febrile temperament indeed there is no questioning her deliberate and reasonable love of literature and all that the word contains not only was she a very shrewd critic of others but pliant as she was in most matters she could be almost obstinate when her literary independence was attacked the many critics who objected to faults of obscurity and technique in her writing she answered indeed but answered authoritatively as a person stating a fact and not pleading a case my poetry she writes to ruskin which you once called sickly has been called by much harder names affected for instance a charge i have never deserved for i do think if i may say it of myself that the desire of speaking or spluttering the real truth out broadly may be a cause of a good deal of what is called in me careless and awkward expression the desire was so honest and valiant that the splutterer may be condoned although there seems to be no reason to agree with mrs browning in her tacit assertion that the cause of truth would be demeaned by a more scrupulous regard for literary form but it is not possible to consider what she might have done had her life been propitious had not one half of it dwindled in a london sickroom had not the other been exposed suddenly to the fierce italian sun and robert browning or if we are to speculate we must remember her own consolation i love poetry better than i love my own success in it we may all know now if we choose to finish the poem in prose what became of waring that he was alfred domett cmg that he went to new zealand rose to be prime minister there and came back the other day after thirty years absence the same as ever nearly with a poem browning moreover wrote to him frequently for some years and the letters with some from another friend joseph arnould are now printed together in a small volume browning it is clear was not what is called a good correspondentwe can almost hear the groan with which he sat down to his task when chris dowson called to bid him get a letter ready seeing that the ship is ready for it one may guess that as a poet he grudged the use of his fine tools upon such rude and trivial work as letterwriting consider these scratches but as so many energetic kickings of the feet and that what they mean is god bless you is the kind of phrase that constantly testifies his dissatisfaction with the scrawled sheets in front of him but although he strives like a giant in chains with the conventional hopes and anxieties and good wishes he gets his meaning expressed in the end with his usual energy almost all the letters are written early before his marriage and the atmosphere is full of hope and defiance the true best of me is to come and you shall have it expect more and better things are phrases called out by his friends enthusiastic trust in him i believe as devoutly as ever in paracelsus and find more wealth of thought and poetry in it than in any book except shakespeare writes arnould in return for this confidence browning expounds some of his aims and theories in his own cryptic and abundant method which may not be quoted here few and fragmentary though the letters are all lovers of browning will feel that they add some vigorous strokes to the poets familiar portrait for new zealand browning mourned in his poem waring first published in bells and pomegranates the poem with which domett returned to england was his epic of new zealand ranolf and amohia wordsworth and the lakes wordsworth wrote his guide to the lakes in to preface a work by the rev joseph wilkinson who had drawn a folio volume of select views but the drawings were as wordsworth was the first to pronounce so intolerable that he had his preface severed from the main volume and published separately in spite of its popularity in this shape however some one asked him whether he had written anything else the book has not been reprinted as a separate volume since and many readers will have reason to thank mr de selincourt for his letter of introduction to a new and happily permanent friend in his excellent preface which besides furnishing all facts suggests the right way of approaching them mr de selincourt tells us something of the sentimental history of the lakes in they were already the subject of curiosity although they had not been domesticated in the sense that they are today the people who went went in the conscious spirit of explorers to bring back tales of what they had seen and to figure hereafter as travellers rather than as private people who might keep their emotions to themselves it was the custom to preserve these experiences in prose or verse but these volumes do not as mr de selincourt says afford invigorating reading there was perhaps some affectation in their appreciation and a tendency to approach lakes and mountains with a mind on the defensive against any attacks upon its sensibility mountains are horrid and when praise is given the curiously obsolete and artificial sound of it suggests that it is inspired by a wish to save the writers reputation as a man of taste rather than by a simple desire to write the truth wordsworth coming after these somewhat perplexed and perfunctory tourists wrote with the calm authority of one who had lived for all but three years of his life among the scenes he describes he has all the courtesy and consideration of an old inhabitant who does the honours of the place to a stranger and who not only undertakes to show him the beauties but will explain from his abundant and wellordered knowledge any fact of history or geography that seems to him worth observation he is jealous for his countrys credit but his familiarity with the place is so perfect that no view will drive him into hasty exaggeration he admires what he has seen and tested during a lifetime and knows to deserve and require every word he bestows at first it is true the readers may detect some oldfashioned formality in his guide he uses still the somewhat rigid vocabulary that was then thought proper for natural things he will talk of a view that is rich in a diversity of pleasing or grand scenery of prospects and situations and he condescends more than a poet should to direct you how best to secure beds at the inn as there is but one and it is much resorted to in summer but this very sedateness has its value and seems to prove that the beauty is real enough to suffer examination by a perfectly candid and conscientious temper these sober details moreover give a tone of solidity to the whole and suggest the rough surface of the earth which is as true a part of the country as its heights and its splendours let us station ourselves in a cloud he begins hanging midway between great gavel or scawfell we shall then see stretched at our feet a number of valleys not fewer than eight diverging from the point like spokes from the nave of a wheel after this general survey he goes on to follow out certain paths in detail making general observations on the form of the country and gradually narrowing his gaze till he gives us those closely observed trifles which only a very penetrating eye after long search could have selected and described he knows not only the scientific reasons why the rocky part of a mountain is blue or hoary grey with a tinge of red in it like the compound hues of a doves neck but also which shade of green is due to the lichen and which to the fern that grows when the first grass is faded but all through this minute and scrupulous catalogue there runs a purpose which solves it into one coherent and increasingly impressive picture for all these details and more which a volume would not be sufficient to describe are of such interest to him because he sees them all as living parts of a vast and exquisitely ordered system it is this combination in him of obstinate truth and fervent imagination that stamps his descriptions more deeply upon the mind than those of almost any other writer days of unsettled weather he says with partial showers are very frequent but the showers darkening or brightening as they fly from hill to hill are not less grateful to the eye than finely interwoven passages of gay and sad music are touching to the ear or again there is also an imaginative influence in the voice of the cuckoo when that voice has taken possession of a deep mountain valley or we observed the lemoncoloured leaves of the birches as the breeze turned them to the sun sparkle or rather flash like diamonds and the leafless purple twigs were tipped with globes of shining crystal he suggests moreover in a curious way the loneliness of nature how one may think of the primaeval woods shedding and renewing their leaves with no human eye to notice or human heart to regret or welcome the change flowers the most brilliant feathers and even gems scarcely surpass in colouring some of those masses of stone which no human eye beholds except the shepherd or traveller be led there by curiosity and how seldom must this happen but a more characteristic passage perhaps is that in which he reflects why it is that a lake carries you into recesses of feeling otherwise impenetrable the reason of this is that the heavens are not only brought down into the bosom of the earth but that the earth is mainly looked at and thought of through the medium of a purer element a thought like that he seems to suggest must be common to every tourist it is as easy for him to see heaven in the earth as to see grass and stones there indeed his quiet assumption that not only mountains trees and lakes but the most minute changes of leaf and herb are the seriously important things in all lives amusing as it is at first persuades us in the end that it is or should be really so for in wordsworths eyes this spectacle of the countryside which we find variously pleasant or delightful as a relief from other things is the most solemn truth that exists it is no mere curiousity or a taste for the picturesque that drives him to walk out among the hills and to know all that can be known about the things that grow there rather he is trying to read the signs which whatever their meaning are to him never made in vain and conscious as he is of a beautifully adjusted symmetry in all natural things his condemnation is most severe of those whose arrogance leads them in any way by their buildings or plantations to violate that order his usual austerity almost breaks into tenderness when he speaks of the little republics of shepherds and farmers which lie among the hills theirs was the perfect life whose constitution had been imposed and regulated by the mountains which protected it and theirs also were the perfect dwelling places which seem to have risen by an instinct of their own out of the native rock and appear to be received into the bosom of the living principle of things this belief so gravely and reverently worshipped one may almost say in the live force which lies beneath woods and hills and is perpetually working in them for good gives to this little book its tone of solemn enthusiasm you draw from it the impression that a walk among the lakes is to be undertaken in a spirit of reverence for the sights which rejoice the eye also minister to the soul it is scarcely fair perhaps to take canon rawnsley as a sequel to wordsworth there are few who would not seem to write diluted english after the terse veracity of the poets prose the canons style moreover starred as it is with a great variety of pretty words and fashioned into innumerable conceits seems if not impertinent at least irrelevant when you remember the respect with which wordsworth subordinated his pen to the truth the snowdrop for instance becomes in canon rawnsleys hands a fair maiden of february who conceals a secret that deep below in the ground is marvellous activity by every rootlets tiniest mouth in the great laboratory of growth in which the spring is chief chemist and so on and so on elsewhere we read of meres and tarns like sapphires tomorrow they will be as white as a dead mans facei when the sun strikes a rhododendron bush it seems as though coloured fire was springing in a fountain from the ground the sun is a rosy jewel the bracken in august is like torrents of green verdure clouds are white galleons that come sailing into seas of sapphire indeed although the canon devotes a chapter to every month the dazzling colours in which he sees them prevent us from realizing what stage of the year we have reached and the individual features of plant and tree are wholly lost in a shower of light if there are any dark days they are cheered by bands of hope meetings parish room concerts magic lantern entertainments and tea drinkings in december finally we feel that we have passed a very innocent and brightly coloured year although we are not quite sure that we have been at the lakes the compromise the skilful description with which the compromise by dorothea gerard opens of a slate quarry in the highlands gives fair promise of what is to come the author writes with such ease that to read her is a safe and pleasant undertaking as an experienced novelist she models her material with a certain largeness and simplicity of touch that defies conventional boundaries thus she skips from generation to generation tells ghost stories and shows a comfortable forgetfulness at times of the necessity of going on with the story it needs a large stage upon which to show the workings of a compromise made between the flesh and the spirit it is necessary to see john mdonnell first as a slate worker then as a student at glasgow then as a minister married to a shallow and worldly wife she plays the part of the flesh in the compact with considerable vitality when he proposes to dedicate his life to the people she is thinking of reforming the dinnertable he has brothers and sisters in the slate quarries while she recognises the bishop and the county people only soon too soon for the readers pleasure she dies and leaves her husband with three children who embody the discord between their parents the elements of a very interesting study are here but somehow they are suggested rather than discussed dorothea gerard keeps upon the outskirts of the problem and therefore upon the outskirts of her characters but at the same time she must be allowed the credit of keeping the balance humorously poised between all extremes she tempers her characters in a way that is pleasantly like nature the weakness of john mdonnell for instance makes it credible that marriage should represent to him that pride of life which necessitates a compromise he is only completely happy and effective when at the end of the book he is left without wife or child glorying in his isolation it is because you are moving all the time in an atmosphere that is cool and natural if in no way stimulating that the considerable length at which the story is told does not become tedious and the writing if somewhat diffuse keeps to a consistently high level it is in short a spacious and temperate book which is satisfactory rather than exciting but which even within these limits must be treated with respect barefacedly glorying in his isolation mrs grundys crucifix the motive if we may call it so of mr vincent browns novel mrs grundys crucifix is suggested upon the fifth page of the volume when the mention of a certain mrs gilpin leads walter ingram to denounce her or rather the institution of which she is a type in words which seem to proceed from the author himself she is the only immaculate thing the british people have ever done she expresses the immortality of money and respectability she is the high priestess of the philistines and the torrent continues vigorously if in somewhat wellworn channels for another page or so the reader may guess what this prologue implies a good woman who has been unfortunate will be sacrificed to mrs gilpin and the characters in the book will be divided into those who minister to the idol and those who deny her divinity and it is very soon clear that this portentous old lady dominates her immediate world in such fashion that a happy english village is transformed into a community with one or two exceptions of abject devotees we are introduced to a scene which is already familiar it is that circus of a small country town in which parson and patron and spinster go through their staid and irreproachable antics if not to our applause at least to our comfortable acquiescence but in this case though all the figures are in their places they suffer some malicious twist before the performance starts we watch all the wits in the town feverishly and ignobly at work upon the reputation of a woman whom they have vague reasons for believing to be disreputable and finally she is confronted with the truth in a scene where the horror is grotesque and the pathos is sentimental the vulgarity and the spite might be there but surely they would be more subtly mixed and at the risk of joining the worshippers of mrs gilpin we confess that it seems to us possible that there was some excuse for them a woman who says it is true i have a little boy at school i have never been married may be the victim of harsh social laws but at the same time the fact here stated does not seem sufficient by itself to prove that she is the noblest of her sex indeed mr brown has given one more proof of the danger of the novel that undertakes a crusade so much of natural human nature so many lights and shades so much truth in short must be sacrificed altogether if you insist upon your crucifix and your crucified and in the end it must be said regretfully we feel small love for the injured woman in spite of her sins and her rescuer is little more than a tract which has been put somewhat crudely into a human case this is all the more to be regretted because mr brown is a clever writer and has made one character harry albemarle with whom the readers sympathies are genuine the bluest of the blue every one who lived in the age of johnson seems to have possessed a little of his genius for sitting for his portrait ladies and gentlemen not otherwise distinguished had the gift of arranging themselves with a certain deliberation and simplicity of pose as though they were draping themselves becomingly for the eye of posterity the group thus formed by those famous ladies the blues has been often reproduced in the mass but it seems questionable whether the single figures will stand isolation in the way that miss gaussen has attempted in the present book there is clearly very little to be said about mrs carter unless you possess a real gift for the interpretation of character and miss gaussen is content with the more superficial part of a biographers duties there is no doubt that the pose which elizabeth carter adopted was from the first that of the learned woman no affectation or pretension need be implied by such a statement for if a woman knew greek in that age she was immediately set apart from her sex and supplied with a character in life from which she could hardly deviate and perhaps it was the consciousness of this separation that made the learned lady so very learned as she must give up all distinctions of another sort she might as well specialise in learning and in the eccentricities which go with it when she was a mere girl elizabeth seems to have made up her mind to be a thorough prodigy not only did she learn the essential greek and latin but also hebrew italian spanish german portuguese and finally arabic although she did not profess to understand the last sufficiently well to read it without a dictionary so much learning needed and inspired heroic qualities she had to struggle with a vigorous frame which slept soundly and loved exercise to conquer sleep she had a bell tied to the head of her bedstead to which a string was attached leading through a crevasse in her window to the garden below at four or five in the morning a friendly sexton tolled the bell elizabeth sprang from her bed and worked at her books till six when she took a stick and tramped the countryside till it was time for breakfast her walking was as vigorous as her reading and she claimed to be one of the best walkers in england snuff and green tea and wet towels were called in to goad her brain to its task and no one can assert that her fame was easily earned the fruit of this immense energy was the publication in of her translation of epictetus and the reception with which it met proved that it was worthwhile to be learned in those days not only did she make by it but it introduced her to the blues and established her in an oracular position for life she did not escape the faults which are common to oracles she could utter common sense as though it were the inspired wisdom of the gods but good judges have put it beyond doubt that she was a very able woman a sound scholar and a shrewd and sensible friend the place she took in the society of the time was rather that of a monitor and instructress apparently than of a wit when it was proposed to form a government of women johnson appointed carter to be archbishop of canterbury who is there he wrote that you cannot influence although she had to prove herself a true woman by producing a shirt and a pudding it was evident that nature meant her to be learned she was shy and shortsighted and came into a room with an idiot look and felt as she said like a dog in a dancing school but her sense and kindliness made her oddities delightful and her learning which was so thorough that she was never conscious of it gave her a place of real authority among her friends fine ladies like mrs montagu and mrs vesey depended on her and the world held no puzzle for her that common sense could not solve or childlike faith accept she deliberately made up her mind that marriage was a very good scheme for everybody but herself and broke off the one connection which might have ended in matrimony because the gentleman wrote some verses of which she could not approve she dreaded nothing so much as irregularity and being strictly high church had the courage to forbear reading any book however sound and sober which proceeded from any other quarter with such qualities it is not surprising that her fortunes were equable rather than exciting and that her life was as long as even she could desire she died in in her eightyninth year and left instructions characteristic of her brave common sense that she was to be buried wherever she died with as little expense as possible coniston the reader of mr winston churchills new novel coniston will be struck once more as he has probably been struck many times already by a certain shabbiness in american fiction when it deals with the natives in their own land and in saying this we refer to a quality in the men and women themselves and in the atmosphere of the place and not to the peculiar manner of the novelist they seem to be dressed by nature in clothes of the last generation which do not exactly fit them in this novel for instance we are introduced to the primitive society of coniston a new england village in the time of president grant where politics are as complicated and apparently as corrupt as in the capital but the glitter and resonance with which such manoeuvres are made attractive in european states are entirely absent here their corruptness is so uncouth indeed that you must suspect some hidden virtue a tanner jethro bass by name becomes with the help of bribery the senior selectman of coniston and thereby forfeits the affections of the ministers daughter the reader it is clear must know something of village politics in new england in order to give these phrases their meaning but mr jethro bass with his ungainly name and his stammer and his twang is a man of great force and ability who studies the life of napoleon and proposes to imitate him in america his career is successful although his victories are not won upon the battlefield and he becomes finally the most important man in his state he has that is carried to such perfection his system of collecting mortgages that he controls the votes of the countryside and can get his bills through the state house and can appoint his own men to the official posts but to follow the transactions of these shrewd men of business who in mr churchills words found so many chinks in the constitution to crawl through and steal the peoples chestnuts that the era may be called the boss era is a very long and somewhat obscure business and mr churchills novel swells considerably beyond the normal limit mr bass has a habit of repeating the last words of his sentences which his biographer seems to have caught from him the book is as long and looselimbed and deliberate as one of the characters themselves and it seems also to have copied the shapelessness of a people whose latent energies are not yet properly fashioned for use there is a considerable amount of latent energy in mr churchills book but it must be dug out of the unchiselled mass he chronicles with infinite patience not only the intricacies of railway politics but the gossip of humorous villagers and the love affairs of young men and women it is love finally that triumphs over jethros corrupt practices and drives him to sacrifice some very substantial advantages for a sentimental consideration mr churchill finally admits that he has grown to love his characters and is reluctant to leave them it seems an affection born more of habit than of passion and he is not able or does not care to observe his old friends too closely but the simplicity of the process and the candour with which he confesses i do not know why i have dwelt so long on such a minor character as bijah except that the man fascinates me induces the reader to agree that such reasons for writing are quite sufficient a confession of this kind however points to mr churchills limitations as an artist he transcribes rather than creates and his effects are got by plodding equably ahead with his narrative rather than by any flash of inspiration but the system is pleasant as it is pleasant on a lazy summers day to listen to a story told by a native in the rustic dialect you rise with the impression that you have absorbed a great deal of the raw material of history and in this case it is a history that will make strange reading the authors progress we have an uncomfortable impression that the author of this book wrote it under some kind of wager not to leave off till the due number of pages was accomplished there is so little you can tell a writer about writing so little even that you can tell him about publishing or it may be that the subject is so essentially depressing that the briefest statement is sufficient and an elaboration of the theme is almost more than the reader can bear for here we have the ugliest form of shop expounded garnished with innumerable jokes and topical allusions solidified with calculations and figures and presented with all the sober conviction of print there is no escaping the fact that a great many people write and most of them write for money and that there are ways of increasing that wage of which the dear young author as mr lorimer calls him would do well to take account let him write to the publisher on good paper stamped with the family crest let him employ no agents let him refuse his photograph to the world but in all other ways let him advertise himself as loudly as he can the result may be mr lorimer has worked out the sales and the expenses and the royalties so many pounds and shillings and pence of hard cash it is affected to pretend that this form of shop is without its interest as it is unreasonable to complain that it is for the most part concerned with very base things the root of the matter is that the confusion between art and trade must always be ugly and that the confusion since writing is sold as boots are sold is inevitable mr lorimers book states the case very plainly and all that goes to make a book successful independently of the book itself may be learnt in his pages sweetness long drawn out there has been lately a rage for the memoirs of respectable or disreputable ladies of the eighteenth century not unlike the fashion which rose at the same time for mezzotints from sir joshuas portraits of women it was not necessary that they should have possessed remarkable minds or should have lived irreproachable lives but it was essential that they should move in brilliant circles should sweep through the world in satin and powder and should charm their way from one splendid height to another by virtue of smiles and courtesies and little exquisite phrases which brought peers and princes to their knees their prosaic descendants were expected to do homage also at the mere recollection of those vanished charms how far such a creature was possible it is scarcely fitting to ask but if she lived at all and lived by means of such graces as these it must surely have been in the age when sir joshua painted her but then the biographer must approach her with peculiar tact for words pierce beneath paint and the souls of pompadours may look fairer upon the surface the difficulties of the task are great we may admit and miss marie hay seems to have complicated them still further by the method which she has adopted in her extraordinary history of wilhelmine von gravenitz it is a true story dug we are told from official archives but the facts briefly stated with colourless reticence by the lawyers have been expanded and embellished in miss hays imagination till they are certainly not reticent and there is plenty of colour although it is not always in quite the right place but her compromise between history and fiction is maintained throughout she is always guiding herself by authentic facts and her emotions are regulated by the documents at her side and here lies the defect of the system she cannot give her imagination free rein and yet she may indulge it to such an extent that the reader does not know when he is reading history and when he is reading fiction this is an awkward frame of mind and the artistic merits of the book suffer from the compromise it is easy to suggest that the figure of wilhelmine invited treatment in one of two ways she might have made an interesting study if her biographer had kept strictly to the truth and allowed her to speak in her own words or she might have posed for a very picturesque portrait in the manner of sir joshua but here we have a composite production where the truth has the vagueness of fiction and the fiction is diluted with fact wilhelmine was the sister of a courtier at the palace of duke eberhard ludwig of wirtemberg the book opens in the year when this gentleman finding that he cannot afford to live there any longer sends for his sister to captivate the duke dethrone the old favourite and raise her own family to the heights with her she is a poor girl of great beauty with the eyes of a witch and the voice of a nightingale and her triumph is instant and complete ah mademoiselle says the duke at their first meeting will you leave the duke here on the balcony and come and look at the stars with the ridiculous poetfellow who could resist him this man with the pleading eyes and deep strong voice wilhelmine at least had no intention of resisting him and the intimacy begun poetically under the stars was continued in all its extravagant and familiar phases for some twenty years it is not difficult in the early stages to be thrilled in the right places by all the cumbersome ceremonial of the little german court the eye is pleased with the pageantry of dance and festival and the ear is flattered with the monseigneurs and highnesses that drop from the lips of profoundly obeisant great ladies and gentlemen wilhelmine has the gift of appearing suddenly in the doorway robed in the gravenitz yellow all eyes are fixed upon her and she achieves some triumph or passes unmoved with her snake glance through some terrible insult but there comes a time when the sensational moment fails to thrill and the sarcasm of the outraged ladies which generally takes the form of suggesting that the favourite has had the smallpox very badly is not sufficiently pointed to draw our blood to make the interest endure when the brilliant surface has worn thin we want to feel that wilhelmine was a highspirited romantic woman in spite of her morals that the duke had some lovable quality that touched her heart and not merely her ambition in short that the whole set of decorous eighteenthcentury figures were driven by human passions and were not the puppets of some elaborate court machine but in spite of many picturesque passages it is difficult to move with any swiftness through the longdrawn vicissitudes of the favourites career they tend to repeat themselves and to twist and turn with languid motion in the familiar channels a novelist here would have been at liberty to select and epitomise but miss hay with the burden of documents on her shoulders follows the story patiently and engrafts upon the bare outline a lavish but indiscriminate wealth of description and conversation which seems not to be spun from the legitimate source of inspiration in her brain but to be the spurious outcome of research in official archives it does not reveal character that is but encumbers it it is enough to say that the favourite rose to be prime minister as well as mistress accumulated lands till the peasants called her the landdespoiler and surrounded herself with splendours of marble and satin that were to rival versailles but it remained a german copy till the end we catch glimpses of her beneath all this shifting mass of finery and of other figures more visionary still but they move in a drifting atmosphere where the laws that bind live men and women can scarcely be applied it is not possible to try their conduct by any ordinary standard nor does their biographer attempt to pronounce the moral verdict wilhelmine falls and we read how in the end a soft evening breeze came stealing round her the long spring twilight faded night drew near and the gravenitz turned away farewell she said aloud the night comes farewell spring and is that the voice of the dismissed courtesan or of her biographer like a faint fragrance of faded roseleaves we read a breath of this womans charm seems to cling and elusively to peep out of the curt record of her crimes but the ordinary reader will question whether the record of wilhelmine might not give off a more pungent odour to other nostrils and still more will he doubt whether this vagrant air is potent enough to steep threehundredandfiftyodd pages in its fragrance a magazine article or a sonnet were the proper vessel for such sweetness trafficks and discoveries whoever has read hakluyt from those five cumbrous volumes in which the printers of thought good to entomb him will have felt the need of the preface or chart which professor raleighs book provides it was possible like one of those early seamen to have ones head so gloriously confused with the medley of rich names and places of spices and precious stones of strange lands and monsters of regal charters and proclamations that the hard outlines of the earth swam and melted in a gorgeous mist the reader could never detach himself sufficiently from the yellow page with its decorative spelling to supply the spectators comment and see the whole pageant in its proper proportions like one groping in the dark he stumbled about the world knocking suddenly against america or beating fruitlessly up and down that long barrier which separated him from cathay and all the splendours of the east the five volumes swung only a warm disc of light over that romantic ambiguity without map or index or editorial footnote to point the way professor raleigh is one of the few writers from whom we can bear illumination and one of whom we can say that although he orders and establishes this miscellaneous world he rather increases than impoverishes its beauty to know that it was all founded on hard truth that the voyagers were substantial elizabethan seamen and that the whole makes a consecutive chapter of english history checks the tendency which we feel towards a vague enthusiasm but founds it on a real and permanent basis and the more detailed our knowledge of the men and their adventures the more potently they touch our imaginations the story as professor raleigh points out is by no means simple there were missionaries and empire builders merchants and men of science among the seamen and you find traces of all these different interests woven into the great theme of adventure and discovery but there is in common to all an immense belief that the unknown world holds what they seek that the future and the veiled continent are alike rich with portentous shadows hardly to be traced by the hand of that age wherever you open the volumes you are struck by the wideeyed credulity of the elizabethan sailors and the largeness of their imaginations stretched to hold any miracle undoubtingly the poets too accompanied these journeys in the spirit and wrought their discoveries into the texture of plays and poems if the voyagers explored new countries and trafficked with strange peoples the poets and dramatists went abroad too and rifled foreign nations returning with farfetched and dearbought wares or explored lonely and untried recesses of the microcosm of man one spirit of discovery and exultant power animated both seamen and poets shakespeare and marlowe were no less than drake and cavendish circumnavigators of the world but it is not as professor raleigh goes on to remark in literature that we must look for the influence of the elizabethan voyagers their actions were not handed down to us in poetry nor are they dependent upon poetry for their survival the charm of hakluyts great book indeed does not lie in any meditated felicity so much as in its air of rough and unsophisticated simplicity so often made a matter for apology by the writers themselves they have neither learning nor leisure to vary or multiply words but their laborious pens dipping into the stately vocabulary which was common to seaman and poet build up such a noble structure of words in the end that the effect is as rich and more authentic than that got by more artistic processes the frequent lists of commodities even have a strange charm and in all these countries there are oak and bortz ashes elms arables trees of life pines prussetrees cedars great walnut trees and wild nuts hasel trees wild pear trees wild grapes and there have been found red plums and there are goodly forests wherein men may hunt and there are great store of stags deer porkpicks and the savages say there be unicorns all the pleasant roots and spices of the earth are massed together with sweetscented trees and gold and silver and precious stones till a fragrance seems to rise from the page itself in these long lists moreover little landscapes are let in all the more romantic because they have been observed with the same sober and veracious eye and inscribed with the same stiff pen you read of perilous woods of the strange thunder of waters of a mighty cataract with diamonds and other precious stones on it which shine very far off of a most beautiful country with fair green grass the deer crossing on every path the birds towards evening singing on every tree cranes and herons of white crimson and carnation perching in the rivers side the air fresh with a gentle easterly wind and every stone that we stooped to pick up promised either gold or silver by his complexion the lustre of that promise is upon all these southern voyages till in drakes voyage round the world it breaks into a blaze of splendour the progress of the pelican and the fleet along the coast of the pacific was as professor raleigh says a carnival of plunder silver and gold in wedges and bars of the fashion and bigness of a brickbat silk and fine linen china ware and precious stones crucifixes set with goodly greaf emeralds poured into the ships in a continuous stream great spanish vessels waited them laden from the kingdom of peru lying innocently at anchor without guard or suspicion the tale reads like some coloured opium dream but the intoxication does not spring solely from the material glitter of the words the profusion of the earth itself seems typical of the whole age and the grosser counterpart of that opulence of the imagination which was now yielding treasures of another sort the bleak voyages to the north and the northeast bear such sentences as that quoted by professor raleigh there is no land unhabitable nor sea innavigable gilbert in the teeth of the storm is seen by those in the hinde sitting abaft with a book in his hand and crying we are as near to heaven by sea as by land suddenly the ships lights went out and they were seen no more wherever you open the book you may find some rough phrase to be tuned to such melody and as you go along you may be your own poet professor raleigh meanwhile keeps the larger scheme of the work before you and makes these phrases its natural ornament anyone then who owns the original text will wish to complete it with this luminous and authoritative comment portraits of places nothing it seems should be so easy as to paint the portrait of a place the sitter reclines perpetually in an attitude of complete repose outside the drawingroom windows he is there whenever you want him he submits to any amount of scrutiny and analysis and moreover there is no need to trouble about his soul we press the point too far indeed when we suggest that he has a sex such a representation of the duties of a landscape artist must of course be entirely insufficient because acting upon it writers have produced by no means encouraging results indeed it is safe to say that if you want to know the look of some town in cornwall or wales or norfolk the best plan will be to get a map and study its portrait there for some reason there is more of the character of a place in this sheet of coloured paper with its hills of shaded chocolate its seas of spotless blue and its villages of dots and punctures than in all the words of an ordinary vocabulary arrange them how you will the swarm of names the jagged edge of the coastline the curves that ships make ploughing round the world are all romantic grains of fact brewed from the heart of the land itself and sluggish must be the mind that would refuse to work with such tools as these and the reason is perhaps that after all the country is a very solid and ancient place and a page stamped with printed words skims off but a thin and superficial slice on the top of it the swiftest portrait carried off by the eye has a great many different elements in its composition although the brain may never separate them or call them by their right names there are associations things you have read or imagined or had driven into you blending with all the blues and greens of the turf and the sky there is scarcely a field in england that is not as mr henry james has it richly suggestive and not easily to be expounded indeed the psychology of the land becomes so increasingly complex the more you think of it that the wonder is that any written picture should do more than cast a flimsy and ineffectual veil over the surface the first touch of the real thing a name with crossed swords over it a cottage with a date upon the door will be sufficient to tear the fabric asunder who then of living writers can present upon his page a spectacle so tremendous with such memories and emotions and experiences seething and blending beneath the placid face that we know so well if any one is fit for the task it must be the same writer who has made such astonishing discoveries beneath other tranquil surfaces indeed it is possible to read mr henry james upon various aspects of the english countryside not only with pleasure and possibly with profit but also certainly with amusement forgetting for the moment the purpose with which we set out of finding a picture that does justice to our own land it is really entertaining to find that we ourselves are part of the show indeed we may be said to be the flower of it and as clearly such a flower is only to be plucked by hands from without mr james starts with one initial advantage over the native chronicler he sees us as the natural and most significant result of all that has gone before and our actions and attitudes point morals and draw pictures that are imperceptible to the shortsighted eye of a person immediately concerned in them perhaps it is this deficiency that makes our own statements of the same kind look so bare and as an american stranger he enjoys yet another advantage for he comes to most of our sights and institutions with an eye that is unblunted by custom add to this his individual gifts of perception and description and you have every right to expect from him a picture that is both pleasant and perspicacious indeed the pleasantness of mr jamess writing is never more serene and persuasive than when he is dealing with countries that are not his own his attitude is that of an irresponsible guest who may look upon the whole of europe as an entertainment preserved long after its original use has disappeared for his own diversion all his duty to his host consists in keeping an open eye for picturesque attitudes and impressions and it would be really harmful to the tact and discrimination of his taste if it were biased by any racial or political prejudices besides it is none of his business to advise the spectacle of a profesional amateur wandering over the world with his brain exposed like a very sensitive photographic film to the outward aspects of things has a singular charm and no little value in this serious age the process seems so simple and so little fatiguing you need merely lounge in front of a picture or ramble at your will about a church or stroll through a town and meanwhile all kinds of pictures are depositing themselves in your brain to be smoothed out upon a sheet of paper when the occasion presents itself it is only what we could all of us do we may say if we chose to keep our eyes at the proper focus but unfortunately if you are a native there is always something to startle you out of the proper detachment only an american can be really impartial where sights of ancient interest are concerned only an american could have written so widely and tenderly and humorously of warwickshire as mr james has done because no english person could forget so happily that shakespeare was born there mr james it is true does not entirely ignore the fact but he contrives to suggest that that was after all what might have been expected from the landscape certainly and that is the important thing you are convinced that he was on the point of going into one of the alehouses to ask mrs quickly for a cup of sack and then he passes quite naturally and decorously as though he were offering a suggestion about the sonnets to discuss the temperaments and appearances of certain young english women who are playing tennis in the parsonage garden they possess according to him no briton could have said it something that he can best describe as an intimate salubrity the face of this fair creature had a pure oval and her clear brown eye a quiet warmth the young man stood facing her slowly scratching his thigh and shifting from one foot to the other he had honest stupid blue eyes and a simple smile that showed his handsome teeth he was very well dressed i suppose its pretty big said the beautiful young girl yes its pretty big said the handsome young man its nicer when they are big said his interlocutress and for some time no further remark was made no english writer would have thought that scene worth recording nor would any shakespearian scholar have believed that it threw any light upon his text but as mr james tells it it illuminates all kinds of things for it is not the descendant of centuries of such conversations in english gardens and english castles and were not the same things said in the time of shakespeare and was not shakespeare himself a link in the same interminable chain it is a little surprising it must be owned to find from mr jamess pages how spectacular we are and were it not for the grace and urbanity with which the show is exhibited we might fairly resent the position in which we are placed we are according to him enormously old we are full of ancient mannerisms and antiquated phrases we have accumulated such a deposit of tradition and inheritance on top of us that the original substance is scarcely to be discovered at any rate it is so thoroughly steeped in associations of all kinds that the commonest handful of english earth like the most ordinary young man or woman at a country teaparty is something venerable and subtle and probably more than a little quaint we were not conscious perhaps of the extreme richness and complexity to use two favourite adjectives of our temperaments and it is not altogether pleasant to be treated with such respect by the young but we may comfort outselves if need be by making an addition to the title of the book and reading or the portrait of an american after portraits of places for both are there still we have no reason to complain if demanding a picture of ourselves we see a good deal of america reflected in our own face when that portrait is after all so charming and so true impressions of sir leslie stephen my impression as a child always was that my father was not very much older than we were he used to take us to sail our boats in the round pond and with his own hands fitted one out with masts and sails after the patterns of a cornish lugger and we knew that his interest was no grownup pretence it was as genuine as our own so there was a perfectly equal companionship between us every evening we spent an hour and a half in the drawingroom and as far back as i can remember he found some way of amusing us himself at first he drew pictures of animals as fat as we could demand them or cut them out of paper with a pair of scissors then when we were old enough he spent the time in reading aloud to us i cannot remember any book before torn browns school days and treasure island but it must have been very soon that we attacked the first of that long line of red backs the thirtytwo volumes of the waverley novels which provided reading for many years of evenings because when we had finished the last he was ready to begin the first over again at the end of a volume my father always gravely asked our opinion as to its merits and we were required to say which of the characters we liked best and why i can remember his indignation when one of us preferred the hero to the far more lifelike villain my father always loved reading aloud and of all books i think he loved scotts the best in the last years of his life when he was tired of reading anything else he would send one of us to the bookshelf to take down the first of the waverley novels that happened to present itself and this he would open at random and read with quiet satisfaction till bedtime he put guy mannering before most of the others because of dandie dinmont whom he loved and the first part of the heart of midlothian he admired so much that his reading of it cannot be forgotten when my brothers had gone to school he still went on reading to my sister and me but chose more serious books he read carlyles french revolution and stopped in the middle of vanity fair because he said it was too terrible he read miss austen through and hawthorne and some of shakespeare and many other classics he began too to read poetry instead of prose on sunday nights and the sunday poetry went on till the very end after the nightly reading had been given up his memory for poetry was wonderful he could absorb a poem that he liked almost unconsciously from a single reading and it amused him to discover what odd fragments and often quite secondrate pieces had stuck to him as he said in this way he had long ago acquired all the most famous poems of wordsworth tennyson keats and matthew arnold among moderns milton of old writers was the one he knew best he specially loved the ode on the nativity which he said to us regularly on christmas night this was indeed the last poem he tried to say on the christmas night before he died he remembered the words but was then too weak to speak them he loved too and knew by heart since he had first read it george merediths love in the valley and he made us remark and this was a rare instance of its kind the beauty of mr merediths metres and his mastery over them as a rule he disliked criticism of technical qualities and indeed disliked being drawn into criticism of any kind he often repeated too with enthusiasm some of sir alfred lyalls verses written in india his taste in poetry was very catholic and if he liked a thing it did not matter who had written it or whether the writer was unknown it stuck to him and was added to his large store he knew many of mr rudyard kiplings ballads by heart and shouted mr henry newbolts admirals all at the top of his voice as he went about the house or walked in kensington gardens to the surprise of nurserymaids and parkkeepersl the poets whose work he most cared to recite were i think wordsworth tennyson and matthew arnold whose scholar gipsey was one of his greatest favourites he very much disliked reading poems from a book and if he could not speak from memory he generally refused to recite at all his recitation or whatever it may be called gained immensely from this fact for as he lay back in his chair and spoke the beautiful words with closed eyes we felt that he was speaking not merely the words of tennyson or wordsworth but what he himself felt and knew thus many of the great english poems now seem to me inseparable from my father i hear in them not only his voice but in some sort his teaching and belief after my mothers death my father was very anxious to take her place and to teach us as she had taught us and for some years he gave up two of his precious morning hours to the drudgery of the schoolroom later on i read with him some greek and some german his method of teaching a language was always the same he put all grammar on one side and then taking some classic made straight for the sense he once said that he owed eton a grudge for not having made a scholar of him in his last years he did not i think read any of the greek or latin classics by himself except his little plato which being of a convenient size for his pocket went with him on his journeys and travelled to america and back he read german but seldom read it for pleasure except heine and goethe during his last illness he read french books by the score the private papers of henry ryecroft when the private papers of henry ryecroft first came out in attentive ears recognised the accent of a true book that would endure when the clamour of a season of books was passed away here was a voice that spoke straight and shapely words at its natural pitch and carried their meaning by the impulse of some rare sincerity to the recesses of the mind since that date much has been said of the author who was held in this little volume to have spoken for the first time in his proper person the novelist it was said had dropped his mask and the sight of the real man beneath had a peculiar interest for readers who had long known the conjuror but that the book has an interest for many who are without this incentive to read it seems proved by the fact that later editions are called for and many to whom the novels of george gissing are unknown read the reflections of henry ryecroft it is not necessary that you should identify the two men and prove them to have one personality apiece when henry ryecroft without other background or circumstance than those he chooses to reveal stands solidly on his own feet and needs no exterior support for with whatever name you christen him there is no doubt that the man who wrote these papers wrote down what he thought and that in this sense it is the most genuine of all autobiographies the interest of the book indeed proceeds to many readers not from the beauty of its writing the sweetness of its humour or the maturity of its knowledge but from the impression that it leaves of a live human creature who has not scrupled to let us know his foibles and his failings and his imperfect human shape it is in no sense a confession but into the sensitive outline much may be read that reticence forebore to state he was a man we learn who had to make his living by writing and to support others for many years his pen and a scrap of paper were the tools with which he had to fashion food and house and clothing finally in middle life when he was beginning to fear that he could hold out no longer a friend died and left him an annuity of it was then for almost the first time and certainly for the last that he wrote because he wished it and left as final bequest these notes of the thoughts and books which came in the end to mean most to him the charm of the writing then is of the sober and tranquil kind like the grey light which comes after the sunset and has no future illumination to hope for or to dread and yet the final impression is by no means melancholy it seems on the whole a creditable thing that a life so bare of outer luxuries should find within itself gifts that could be sufficient by themselves he was born with qualities that are neither rare nor splendid good brains for instance and a passion for books but it is inspiring to see how these two gifts in their naked austerity for neither ever attracted anything foreign to it are able to supply all that a man wants at any rate all that he needs to be a respectable independent and harmless human being if one must feel that such epithets applied to a strenuous life are somewhat meagre they have yet the charm of flawless integrity it seems as though henry ryecroft had pared down every emotion every thought and every book until the pith of it only remained as if poor men may not afford to feel or to think insincerely and the residue is the pure metal of such strong and equable heat that it will irradiate the whole of a mans life so that it becomes worth living it is hard that even such a talent for economy of both kinds was not sufficient to keep him possessed of the few things he wanted he had to sell books in order to buy warmth and light and he had to go without the pleasures of the country and these are sacrifices that imply many others then again he had to sell his brains and in a double sense for if he had had the means to use them respectfully they might have kept their value undiminished all this paring down did it cannot be doubted cut him to the quick for his capacity for happiness was radically weakened when the chance for using it came the harsh fights in his youth when he struggled for the little ray of joy there might be in reading and walking had strained his muscles so that he could not grasp firmly the beautiful and abundant treasures that surrounded him at the end his delight in the spring at last when he has time to know it is made tremulous by the knowledge that haunts him of the few that can enjoy it with him and he must ask himself whether i shall not have to pay by some disaster for this period of sacred calm still one must ask what would have been his lot had he been a rich man had he been able even to feed his brains on all the things they craved he might have been an owleyed pedant a don who had never left his college walls and that may have been what nature meant in shaping the sensitive meditative man but had she been consistent we should never have had the sight grotesque and painful but deeply inspiring also of this owl turned out among the harsh lights and rough corners of the world he would have had no need to measure books with life to know men as well as letters and to come finally to a philosophy of his own that was lean and muscular and serviceable in every strand of it the result of such training was that the smallest sum that left him in peace to read by himself in the country was such a competence to him as it could not have been had he learnt even unconsciously to buy things with money given food and clothing and his own brain would do the rest and thus it is that the picture of a middleaged literary man sitting in a devonshire garden and reading all day long is not the mild benevolent portrait that we know but something even heroic his daily life his food his servant his room are all worn down till every superfluous quality is gone and only what poverty has taught him to be essential remains nothing that he owns is without its beauty of use and scrupulous refinement my house is perfect just large enough to allow the grace of order in domestic circumstance the fabric is sound in the garden i can hear singing of birds i can hear the rustle of their wings and thus if it please me i may sit all day long and into the profounder quiet of the night oh blessed silence how much one may ask must one not have suffered to appreciate these things how much must one not have read for when all else has been attenuated and economised the love of books alone has grown strong and lusty only with the weary cynicism of a man who has failed he is inclined to put more trust in books than in people it might be said that books are to him no relief from life or comment upon life but are life itself save for some stretches of the english countryside where he has the strength to walk and botanise and even these he sees instinctively through some veil of written words like all exquisitely literate minds his brain plays a kind of battledore and shuttlecock with life and literature a passage of print suggests a sunny meadow or a lighted window in the evening lane sends him thirsting to tristram shandy he wakes in a strange place at night and hears church bells then a glow came over me we have heard the chimes at midnight master shallow this enriching process is never complete there are always strange new islands floating somewhere in remote seas to be explored and plundered of their treasures there is the ancient geography of asia minor there is egypt there are all the histories that call up pictures out of the abyss and let them slip again but it does not matter perhaps the last fault of which i shall cure myself is that habit of mind which urges me to seek knowledge and at the end he could wish for many another year not because the years would bring him new things but because they might let him live on thus with a passive body and a mind ranging over the world and coming back to settle in that corner of it which he had chosen this is the kind of freedom so delightful and so sufficient that all might desire and the charm of the book is that it suggests not only that such a power exists but that it lies within the grasp of most of us a book a pen a cottage in the country and the world is at your feet temptation mr richard bagot has one advantage over the ordinary novelist he has a knowledge of italy which allows him to take that land for his stage and its people for his actors in his new book temptation for instance there is a great charm superficially at any rate in the mere change of scene the life is so different the manners are so picturesque and over all lies such a magic of place that you are willing to concede much to the novelist who can produce the illusion but on a closer inspection the result is not quite so satisfactory for with all the appreciation and understanding of an admirer mr bagot is still the sympathetic stranger interested in habits and observant of differences there is a hint that the purpose of the book is to illustrate italian life for our instruction and we are to compare and draw conclusions but apart from this formality and it is less noticeable as the story proceeds the book is interesting as an able study of character and whether it is italian character or english character matters but little there is a certain count ugo vitali the head of an ancient family of the provincial nobility who lives in his ancestral palace at viterbo he has married beneath him a woman whose beauty and whose passions hint at the peasant blood in her veins she is ambitious of all the things that her husband distrusts for he is a simple country gentleman of aristocratic instincts with the interests of his people much at heart then there is the cousin from rome who comes to stay and talks philosophy cristina listens and finds the philosophy pleasant she is terribly bored by her husband finally she brings herself to believe in his disloyalty the end and the plot is slight is very much what you might expect from the womans character and if we add that the end is violent it will be seen that mr bagot has written skilfully with less restraint of treatment the last chapters might be not only unpleasant but also incredible and we certainly believe all that we are told the truth is that we could believe something more mr bagot spends so much care on the few characters whom he introduces and offers so close an explanation of their motives that we are prepared both for greater vigour of action and greater subtlety of speech but he seldom drops his attitude of the grave observer pondering wide issues in any case however it is an interesting book you lay it down not infrequently but you open it with respect fraulein schmidt and mr anstruther fraulein schmidt and mr anstruther by the author of elizabeth and her german garden contains the letters of an independent woman one rosemarie schmidt of jena to mr anstruther of the foreign office in london to whom for a brief period she was engaged they broke off their engagement but she still went on writing to him she may well be writing to him now she is probably writing to some one else and the final i shall not write again is a mere pause for breath as who should say you must wait a moment while i change my dress mr anstruther does not appear once even as a reflection in the mirror and there is cause to believe that this is for the good reason that he does not exist it is rosemarie then who is important but why should she be called fraulein schmidt and supplied with the troublesome properties of her part when she is really elizabeth in a german lodging house or princess priscilla or any other cultivated woman with a taste for poetry and a fluent pen that this is so points of course to serious limitations for it means that the book is merely a record of personal impressions veiled but scarcely coloured by a few conventions of name and circumstance and that these are so thinly laid upon the surface that you may shift them altogether if you choose rosiemarie was not in love nor was she poor nor did she know how to cook but to say precisely what she was is more difficult and it is probable that different readers will answer differently she was charming all would agree or why should we read with various degrees of pleasure it is true a whole volume of her meditations which are without form often shallow sometimes slipshod and never inspired but she writes so freshly and sensibly and happily that to ask for a closer attention to these matters would be like asking a thrush for example to whistle a bach fugue she follows her moods and delights in them the weather time of day the light in the room the scent of certain flowers the sound of certain voices the instant my senses become aware of either of these things i find myself flung into the middle of a fresh mood the violets in schillers garden the beans in the englishmans field stevenson whitman the notes of a violin she is at the mercy of all these sounds and smells and her ecstasies carry her buoyantly as on the back of curving waves which never rise too high for comfort over all the experiences of life the experiences that admit of this treatment best are homely ones vegetarianism for example and servants and the pettiness of life in a small german town there the humour is exhilarating and sufficient but it does not lift more weighty matters successfuly the muse never seized and shook him goethe till divinenesses dropped off his pen without his knowing how or whence perhaps what you really want most is a prolonged dose of walt whitman the faint breath of corruption hanging about christina rossettis poetry makes me turn my head the other way and at least in one place she gives directions as to the proper use of green grass and wet dewdrops upon her grave implying that dewdrops are sometimes dry is this the place be the green grass above me with showers and dewdrops wet and if thou wilt remember and if thou wilt forget we turn our heads away too but if you accept the point of view there is as we began by saying charm in the frankness and simplicity in the verbosity even with which it is written down as though you listened to vivacious talk and conceived an affection for the talker for the sake of tones and gestures not to be called reasons and not always to be defined that is why this book will be popular with many and why to many criticism will seem beside the point the glen o weeping miss marjorie bowen writes a preface to her new book the glen o weeping in which some rather emphatic opinions upon the proper writing of history are flung together in haste as it seems the unconscious historian is the only one that may be trusted the letters in fact of the worlds statesmen and women hume and smollett are pernicious because they merely chronicle opinions that the dogma of the prejudiced and the acceptance of the unthinking have converted into what are known as historical facts drink your history neat in short but beware we might add lest the fumes are too strong for your head and colour historical facts no less queerly than the spectacles of the scientific historian but this is an old quarrel and only pertinent here because miss bowen has cast aside her hume and her smollett and uses the same sarcastic commas for the massacre of glencoe and for these opinions and facts probably no true novelist makes it his business to administer strict historical justice and we think him successful in the best sense if he can set people talking and fighting once more and thinking even as they did and do to this very day but although there are only two absolute liberties with facts honestly confessed and the truth of the matter is a question we cannot go on to say that miss bowen has written a book which we must believe though all the doctors in oxford cried shame on us and yet she possesses some of the gifts that should make a novelist people group themselves before her she sees lonely figures watching on the shore and solitary horsemen on deserted roads the picture forms itself instinctively it is there in every chapter and we must add with speed that there is a great deal more than this and we should even find it hard to give an intelligible sketch of the plot there is the feud of the campbells and the macdonalds the jacobite plots the orange plots and above all the master of stair miss bowen is as daring in her way as one of her own conspirators she shirks no crisis she is lavish of adventures and escapes and a murder is undertaken with the utmost indifference still while we admire her spirit it is difficult to feel that all this slightly grandiloquent magnificence is satisfactory it is a rich cloak but it does not take the place of bones and flesh philip sidney so simple and complete is the image that we have of sir philip sidney that we use his name almost as an adjective as we speak of don quixote when we wish to give a figure to a cluster of closely related qualities the cup of water and the phrase thy necessity is yet greater than mine though very nearly the last of his actions and his speeches have inspired all that went before them in the imaginations of most for not many it is likely draw their information from the arcadia and the life by greville unless this reprint attracts as much attention as it deserves is not known to the ordinary reader at all and yet the life of which we have here a reprint edited and annotated by mr nowell smith is the first authority for that phrase and as seems likely the original though hidden source of much that is scarcely so articulate sir fulke greville was the author of several plays and poems political treatises rather than plays says lamb and poems frozen and made rigid with intellect so you might go on to qualify the term life as applied to this pamphlet which professes to be a dedication and is a volume which has much of spain and elizabeth and greville in it and very little of the life of any one unless we choose to divorce the word from the hard framework of date and fact to which in our day it has grown so close but if this is not the method of biography of which we approve if we like letters and dates and events all ranged in order surely we must admit that in good hands it has advantages and that in the case of sidney particularly it is the only way in which the rare stuff of his life could be preserved and made of value sir fulke began as we said to dedicate his poems but the name of philip sidney so wrought upon his imagination that he could not stay till he had fashioned a monument to him carved and decorated it twisted and plaited it in the best style of the early sevententhcentury prose and like other sepulchral monuments it celebrates the virtues of the dead and traces the outlines of their form with a smooth and generous hand but it is neither mere panegyric such as you speak to patrons nor is it the mournful eulogy that is chanted appropriately over the bodies of heroes and yet it has much of the exaltation and largeness of period that are common to both these styles even so perhaps it still seems natural to write of philip sidney the figure of sidney alive making love making war writing poems or walking in the gardens at wilton cast upon the minds of his contemporaries the same image only infinitely brighter that is still visible before us they did not see a poet or a soldier or a statesman but a man who somehow held all these qualities latent in his mind but so fused that no one of them issued separately the difficulty of writing his life at all was that there was no point to indicate to the eye of posterity as the sufficient reason of sidneys fame but all qualities rather must be kept melting and mixing in their confinement beautiful in their sum and in their harmony rather than in the supremacy of any single one of them and yet that was also the reason of writing for there was need to fear that a future age with no proof before it might disbelieve that any such man had ever lived and that death might have more power over a frame so exquisitely composed than over one made in a coarser pattern for to know the perfection of sidneys nature it is clear you must have known him in the flesh only the minutes and the seconds of daily life were fine enough in texture to receive the impression of so rare a spirit such was the task that greville set himself to the end that in the tribute i owe him our nation may see a seamark raisd upon their native coast above the level of any private pharos abroad so happily careless of detail where the mass was so admirable greville stands back from his model and composes the fulllength figure as a work of art detached from time and matter like a greek statue where the foot is necessary to the head the familiar course of sidneys life followed the pattern usual to young men of his rank he travelled the continent in the suite of a nobleman conversed with emperors and men of letters learnt to ride and finally attached himself to the court of elizabeth but as it seemed to greville and to all who knew him and we must acquiesce he was never possessed of any fit stage for eminence to act upon all his virtues were but hinted or spilt by the way in pamphlets and arcadias to the anger and pride too of his friends if he had chosen to economise what might he not have done and yet such is the carelessness of wealth as a boy even he was always for enlarging the task given him to do and for expanding the ceremonies of diplomacy so as to make them include matters of vital interest to his country his stage became steadily wider it spread over england ireland and spain and had fate allowed it was to embrace the main of america as an emporium for the confluence of all nations that love or profess any kinde of vertue or commerce and this was undertaken from no mere opulence of spirit but gravely like all his plans with the sagacity of a farsighted statesman had he lived so we may guess with greville his nature would have found its proper scope in rule and statecraft for it was in the temper of a magistrate after all that he approached the peaceful arts he was not so much a poet or a romance writer as an explorer of fresh tracts for other men to cultivate and in the best sense of the word a patron of poets one may figure him still leading at wilton or at leicester house with spenser and greville for followers and indicating as from some summit above his men the noble land which they are to press on and occupy so he reclaimed classic metres strange to english verse and pronounced his eloquent defence of poesie but the truth is his end was not writing even while he wrote such was the characteristic opinion of his friend at any rate who perhaps had two ends in his mind it was one end to conceal sound political philosophy within the bodies of fantastic princes living in arcadia in all these creatures of his making his intent and scope was to turn the barren philosophy precepts into pregnant images of life modern readers will be less alive to the moral and will endow sidney with a greater measure of purely literary inspiration than greville thought due to him or entirely to his credit but there was another end not to be reached by pen and ink for we may agree that his knowledge was not moulded for table or schools but both his wit and understanding bent upon his heart to make himself and others not in word or in opinion but in life and action good and great in which architectional art he was such a master with so commending and yet equall waies amongst men that wheresoever he went he was beloved and obeyed the temptation is to copy out still more of one of the many noble passages in the book and it is hard too to resist a temptation not altogether so innocent for upborne upon such stately pinions it would be easy to glide in serene air to exalt and magnify till the figure of sidney became of colossal proportions and we might find ourselves in the end mouthing fine periods about a man who had ceased to exist but greville was not only a statesman and a philosopher but also a writer of fine english prose he had of course the vices of his time in that he used a medium not yet refined for utilitarian purposes and he is often closely throttled in the embraces of a sinuous metaphor mr nowell smith has had to perform and most adequately has he done it the task of an editor of a corrupt classic and on more than one occasion the meaning must still be left an open question but the obscurities arise from a congestion of precious metal ideas and images and learning collide and block the way but when the stream runs clear it is both swift and deep in these passages says mr nowell smith he haunts the ear with that solemn and rich and varied rhythm which is the peculiar glory of elizabethan and jacobean prose and he goes on to point out the beauty of one particular chapter and paragraph but pleasant as it is for the cultivated modern to find in grevilles book a collection of rare old curiosities to be handled separately it has a higher value perhaps as a complete work in which the whole figure is embalmed and there is no rent perceptible in the encircling envelope for although sidney is raised a little beyond the ordinary human stature so that his outline runs free unchecked by petty interruptions and has become a seamark and a standard for men to sail by it is due to his friends art that it is still a solid figure which we may feel warm to our touch if it is true that he is a type and has something of the general and public nature of a type the type after all was closely allied with the particular for it is the virtue of the elizabethan age unless imagination is too partial that such heroes should have space to expand there to their natural circumference and men can stand back and gaze at them so that when sidney died at the age of thirtytwo his death was but the final harmony of a life that was too short but that was complete indeed the shortness of such lives seems in some way a necessary part of their perfection poets sang of him as an ideal fit for worship and other countries besides his own lamented as though some image common to them all had been withdrawn from sight best of all is the tribute of his friend for there you hear a sterner note than eulogy and see the exact countenance that was then deemed heroic indeed he was a true modell of worth a man fit for conquest plantation reformation or what action soever is greatest and hardest amongst men withall such a lover of mankind and goodnesse that whosoever had any real parts in him found comfort participation and protection to the uttermost of his power like zephyrus he giving life where he blew lady fanshawes memoirs the memoirs of lady fanshawe are probably the memoirs of many other ladies of her time who did not go to the trouble of writing them down such were the stories that were current in halls and manor houses all over england in the luxurious restoration days how your father was the tenderest father imaginable how he loved hospitality which he thought wholly essential for the constitution of england was loyal honest and walked often with a poetry book in his hand listen then while i tell you how he lived so that you may live like him and grow up true and charitable and discreet the writer in this instance might go on to speak of grandfathers and uncles and aunts all of them honest worthy virtuous men and women who served god in their generation and lay now obscure beneath their tombs indeed she could hint at far generations doubtless once practising the same virtues who had accumulated in the chancel of the church at dronfield and bore the same name spelt variously ffaunchel ffauncall or fanshawe above them nor would it be hard for a stranger who finds himself in that churchyard or comes upon the low little stone house from which they issued to perceive a family history running alongside of all seasons of english life inconspicuously as a murmured accompaniment so set humming the whole land seems to swim in a pleasant kind of harmony in which no age is more present than another and all are of the one piece lady fanshawes memoirs serve but to freshen colours now grown dim one might read them beneath the yew tree on a hot summer day with no sense of incongruity no discordancy she was the daughter of sir john harrison and through her mother cousin already of the fanshawe family her father was a member of five parliaments and a devoted servant of the royal cause which as a rich man he supported with his purse ann was educated in working all sorts of fine works with my needle and learning french singing the lute the virginals and dancing but a vigorous love of active pastimes breaking through these restraints made her that which we graver people call a hoyting girl at oxford where they had come with the court she married her husband sir richard fanshawe the talk of battles in her ears sickness and the spectacle of war before her eyes and immediately the turbulent business that was to last their life together began she makes as perhaps she once made on her knees some solemn little preface to this undertaking as faith is the evidence of things not seen so we upon so righteous a cause cheerfully resolved to suffer what that would drive us to and without further meditation she began her voyages and shipwrecks and adventures till having lavished herself with characteristic profusion bearing eighteen children in twentyone years for example and losing most of them she was laid in the church of ware beside her husband it is the lack of meditation in proportion to so much action that strikes the reader and colours if we do not mean rather washes with a single shade the whole book the atmosphere is singularly clear you see what happens now and what comes next the clothes sir richard wore the wondrous fruits that drooped from trees the commodities of the land the detail and solidity of things as in a childs story of adventure it is a method full of charm a method it seems that marks another age indeed we should miss a great deal if we tried to convict lady fanshawe of much fine feeling it is precisely her candour and simplicity that are valuable adding nothing to the fact but at the same time in no way obscuring it in october as i told you my husband and i went into france by way of portsmouth where walking by the seaside two ships of the dutch shot bullets at us so near that we heard them whiz by us at which i called my husband to make haste back and began to run but he altered not his pace saying if we must be killed it were as good to be killed walking as running an attitude of mind which lady fanshawe gives us to understand is proper to a nobleman on all occasions such is the rather serene and florid spirit easily to be made visible to the eye in which the whole drama is presented the two embassies to madrid the shipwrecks the escape from cork the imprisonment of sir richard their adventures stir in them no petty feelings of resentment against men or against nature it is the lot of gallant knights to tilt nobly against obstacles as the knights in the faery queene proved their chivalry against the monsters of allegory so when they part with charles i i prayed god to preserve his majesty he stroked me on the cheek and said child if god pleaseth it shall be so but both you and i must submit to gods will thus did we part from that glorious sun that within a few months after set to the grief of all christians that were not forsaken by god the phrase is round it gives the surface and the ceremony much as a curtsey duly regulated expresses what it is proper to feel in the presence of the sovereign but the pen is scarcely more subtle than the knee after all we must allow that in an age when there was so much ceremony so much action needed merely to cross to spain we saw coming towards us with full sail a turkish galley well manned and we believed we should all be carried away slaves it would have needed a deeper mind than lady fanshawes to accept all these events and stain them in any peculiar dye or crack them open and show what was inside as it is there is so much of a likeness between one thing and another as they appear in this medium that we give almost the same value to the story of the little portuguese boy who was rolled in honey as to the restoration of charles ii on both occasions it is the show that the writer lays before us without comment almost without arrangement but the charm of such unconsciousness is that it permits her to make statements plainly which most writers would in some way distort and the reader has the pleasure of filling in the picture with fresh colours i found a twenty shilling piece of gold which nobody owning that was by i kept of irish ghosts she spake aloud and in a tone i never heard thrice ahone and then with a sigh more like wind than breath she vanished your father entertained me with telling how much more those apparitions were usual in ireland than in england it is something of a surprise to find that this candid tale with its air of something naturally completed a statement as round and as detached as a birds song is in need of five appendices and nearly closely printed pages of notes the supplement includes not only the minute comment of history but the still more minute additions of family pride and both together make lady fanshawes memoirs a matter of far greater or other importance than she or her readers were aware the perspective is changed of a sudden and instead of vague business into which she did not inquire too narrowly you have accurate texts faithfully recovered from the originals in the british museum the bodleian the public record office and from nearly a thousand printed volumes you have what pepys wrote and evelyn distances measured on the map a precise examination of dates and christian names for lady fanshawe was casual even as to her own children a little biography of every name she mentions and often a genealogy as well till the family of fanshawe seems to cast itself like an intricate net over the entire population of england the curiosity of such speculations is great some one with a fiery imagination might fuse the text and its notes into such a whole as should constitute a complete little globe of human life meanwhile the book remains curious delightful so far as lady fanshawe is concerned elaborate and admirable so far as we can absorb her editor the touch a real personage whose memory is specially dear to the family of her husband colours much very pleasantly that we are apt to call mere antiquarianism lady fanshawe it seems is still a grandmother the new religion no one has any right perhaps with a title like the new religion and the additional clause a modern novel and the dedication for those who are sick for those who believe they are sick and so on to be very much surprised by what follows and yet there are moments of illusion a beautiful young woman waiting her husbands return in a country garden soft affectionate pureminded a faithful business man submitting tenderly to the punctual buttonhole whose years confirm his sincerity here is the stuff for close domestic analysis combined perhaps with some debate of current heresies but before this picture has established itself it is clear that the interest does not lie in those regions at all but to begin with in the state of mrs lomass health she is ill and there is a country doctor who hints at a possible complication then there is a specialist and then another specialist and then we see that it is not mrs lomass health that we are to be interested in but health in general and doctors of all kinds each character is introduced in turn with some familiar phrase on his lips they come so swift and so pat that the reader has to abandon any original desire to follow the fortunes of individuals and must devote all his agility to taking the points as they rise a restless exacting duty not however to be forgone he will have to listen to private conversations between dr russett the greatest living nerve specialist and his wife the whole things just a big financial and social spec he remarks when his wife murmurs something about the cause of humanity next a boy proves the victory of prayer over surgery and an old gardener pleads the cause of charms and simples when all these points have been made with considerable vivacity mrs lomas is pronounced to be suffering from general debility and dr russett prescribes a year in a sanatorium in the vaudois alps which will cure her if as he remarks in the hall she has not a spine complaint which is incurable at gringingessuraulches there is a vast establishment dedicated to the return to nature the founder dr vourray has discovered that man is nearly allied to the apes and live as the monkey and you will regain your lost strength is the creed here mrs lomas was shut in a dark room with a nurse who exhibits submissively but as pointedly as the rest the vices of her class while henry lomas undergoes the treatment prescribed for apoplexy since as the doctor discovers his symptoms point to that disease to bring down the whole of this colossal imposture henry lomas is suddenly stricken with consumption and a mad patient breaks into mrs lomass isolation at nighttime while her nurse sleeps the next task then is to exhibit the fallacies that are current with respect to consumption dosimetry in this case and the riviera but the proof this time requires that the invalid shall die and another symptom directly takes his place in the person of mrs lomass divorced father who suffers from something that we are now perhaps permitted to call angelina pectoris for in truth the point of view has once more shifted the satire of the earlier chapters was after all directed against the solid bodies of doctors and faiths and it was possible for mr maartens to inspire them with rigorous rhetoric tis the new religion cried dr russett nobody listens to the poor dead parsons we are the new infallible priests and so on and though we have heard this before we feel that we ought perhaps to believe in it but now the connexion with things that are shaped somewhat after the fashion of life is blown aside and mr maartens indulges a delightful irresponsible mood which neglects all the missions and charges nobody with the disagreeable duty of abolishing shams can we believe for example in the doctor who to refute the germ theory of disease swallows a tinful of tubercles and calls his daughter microbe damour my cabbage she infecteth nobody but it is amusing again shall we conceive a millionaire endowed with sufficient imagination to cruise among the aegean islands in search for a prophet with miraculous powders that either cure you or kill you but the story is one of the most charming in the book at last we are entertained with a wild jumble of the different creeds in conflict issuing from the lips of valets and ladies maids and sea captains and the babble of petroleum pills biblical texts and autosuggestion is the exhilarating effervescence into which all the sense and satire of the book boil over it is a mistake to impose a solid ending upon such chaos nor do we believe that dr russett cedes the lomas property upon which he had built his gigantic sanatorium his culminating fraud or that young russett after proving his devotion by swallowing a powder marries mrs lomas with the chronic spinal complaint or that his final vow is to succour the sick we have not believed in the loves or the diseases nor have we profited by the satire but we have been very much entertained and wit and fantasy are good call them what you will a swan and her friends macaulay so we read in those marginal notes of his that have just been published once amused himself by going through the six volumes of miss sewards letters with a pen in his hand surely no more effective and economic way could be found nor does it need great subtlety of disposing of such a rubbish heap and of preserving any trifle of value that may chance to lie hid there one quotation for quotation has already been made in these columns will be enough the latins miss seward remarks rebuking pleasant mrs piozzi place their lyric horace next to their epic virgil much more on account of his odes than of his satires what latins asks macaulay there is not a word of the sort in any latin writer then it was her grammar then her taste finally we have the verdict was ever such pedantry found in company with such ignorance which we should do well perhaps to couple with some softer phrase to the effect that she could write simply when for example she was describing the last illness of her tiresome old father but this is not the way that seems good to mr lucas and we agree with some of his reasons for thinking that miss seward and her friends deserve an ampler investigation not only were their views on most matters of literature and life repulsive to us but they were as mr lucas points out acclaimed with enthusiasm by the mass of the intelligent people of their time what kind of society that was and the nature of the revolution that destroyed it is surely an interesting topic enough and in this case the extravagance of the contrast and the delightful emphasis with which the old monstrous doctrine was expressed make it as lively a subject as the wittiest could desire but mr lucas is neither historian nor satirist he is content with the simpler duties of the caricaturist with the useful but modest art of the maker of amusing books let us grant at once that the portentous swan tempts the parodist if any one ever did her writing is of the kind that you feel to be almost too good to be true another touch and it is incredible that touch would have come from some convincing correspondence between her life and her work and we cannot bring ourselves to believe that she ever gave it and a true humorist would also refrain he would lead us as miss bates leads us to the very limits of comedy suffer us perhaps to glance at the ridiculous and then by means of some skilful light upon another side of the character he would draw us smoothly away give our comic sense a respite and urge it forth again with a fresh start thus the character would float buoyantly all the time within its proper limits but mr lucas is not careful of limits he wishes us to laugh to laugh almost incessantly and so the chance he had of drawing in these three hundred pages an exquisitely comic figure typical not only of lichfield and the time but of something vast and enduring in human nature is lost we have instead the conventional buffoon for she could be made of course to comport herself precisely as the caricaturist would have her so that it is possible as mr lucas has proved to let her mouth forth a whole volume of autobiography in what he calls sewardese but how much of it is characteristic of her how much is merely the exaggerated manner in which all secondrate writers parody the temper of their age what in short is really the flesh and blood behind this drapery the idea that this particular pose represents mr lucas deals lightly with a few of these questions why should miss seward need a biography because it is interesting to mark changes and nothing could be less sic out of place in the present day than anna sewards pontifical confidence her floridity and her sentimentalism why was she admired because she was a pioneer because a fashion for poetry was in the air there are certain phases of human incompetence that really are worth examination and miss seward it is added was the last and greatest of the unhumorous women and then we hear what lamb said about miss benjay we read not perhaps for the first time miss pinkertons letter in vanity fairzz and we are told what it is true we did not know before that i entered lichfield in a station omnibus filled otherwise with a commercial traveller and three rural deansithe first ten or twenty pages of the performance are so comic for one reason or another that we are ready to sink all our objections to the method the swan as mr lucas says sprang from the egg almost fully fledged she began by writing verses at the challenge of erasmus darwin who doubted whether she could really do all that fame protested at once the verses spout profuse and pompous with the same capital letters the same platitudes rounded and rhymed that were to serve her all her life for poetry unfortunately however it was not until that she kept copies of her letters and there is little record of a time that was not perhaps completely obscured by the full development of her style but even at the age of twentyone this was the way in which life was arranged she describes the engagement of a younger sister i stood by her toilet while she dressed she sighed often and once or twice exclaimed ah heaven in a pensive languid tone and with an emphatic shake of the head as she put on her light hat and ribands bless me said i one would think thou wert adorning a victim and not a mistress if that idea has passed across thy mind prithee put a stop to this business at once study a pretty harangue of dismissal l and so on and so on there is one shrewder phrase i grew so saucy to my mother that she took her pinch of snuff first at one nostril and then at the other but after that we have superabundant reasons for knowing how she thought that she ought to think and how she trained herself to express it it would be easy and delightful to quote to make her illustrate every vice that is known to literature to indicate most of the vices that can infect the character we are gorged with falseness of every description the whole society echoes her accents the hayleys the ansteys the whalleys and the potters deluge us with bad criticism bad poetry and bad emotion we laugh till we are bored and we are bored because we are still conscious that this is all too far removed from life to give us much reason to dislike or love or know them more than any other tedious and prolix people much at the mercy of their pens we are only curious to know why it is that clever people as these were ever thought it right to submit to such a convention for there are touches that remind us that they had brains and that they lived we hear miss seward dub herself a fat cook maid and laugh in private with the bard of sussex over her lameness and her figure scott who received her letters with despair really liked her when he met her and heard her talk with the keenness and vivacity of youth with a ready perception of the serious and the ludicrous and listened to her admirable mimicry of johnson it is this that tantalises the reader for here we feel and dimly see that it is a toweringly humorous figure who did contrive to embody with overwhelming success an ideal of the moment because among other reasons she embodied it with more vigour than other people ten pages are enough to prove to us that she was ludicrous but the essential point of her that her letters half cover and half express a genuine attitude towards life is what mr lucas with all his vivacity fails to show william allingham are we on the whole to regret the fortune that left william allinghams autobiography unfinished and gave us the chance of reading his diaries and notebooks unprepared as he wrote them the finished narrative covers his childhood and the first years of his youth a time that seems always most happily treated by people of imaginative temper because the view is broad and there are at the same time events of inexplicable interest which seem to sum up long trains of thought and experience suddenly in some quaint symbol persistent all through life allingham remembered certain trees that grew in the garden at ballyshannon one leafy spray that touched my face was an enchantment beyond all telling vague warm scented white roses and fig trees with crooked boughs stables with forks and currycombs where perpetual twilight reigned and all these things shaped and coloured his life with their odd meanings far more than the real people about him but when these first impressions have ceased to come together into pictures and the world intrudes obstinate questionings and much dull action which must be recorded then in default of the supreme artist mr allinghams plan of short spontaneous notes seems happiest in spite of his appointment in the customs in ireland he found time for frequent visits to london where in he knew first leigh hunt a friendly communicative man who was ready to bestow all the wealth of the age upon the boy who had an enthusiasm for letters dickens he exclaimed a pleasant felow carlyle i know him well browning lives at peckham because no one else does i will take an opportunity of asking dickens carlyle and browning to meet you gracious powers indeed whether it was due to leigh hunt or to his own merits or to the convenient nature of literary society in those days allingham was soon admitted to all the great men and able to talk with them familiarly of their friends and their writings he met tennyson at twickenham in a tall broadshouldered man strange and almost spectral in appearance who began reading allinghams own poems aloud in rich slow solemn chant and spoke of george merediths poems lately sent him author only twentythree i thanked him for it and praised it love in the valley the best when allingham lived at lymington some years later he saw much of tennyson and has to record not so much definite stories of him as an impression of the whole vast nature of the man his odd simple ways and direct speech they came to a large tangled fig tree its like a breaking wave says i not in the least says he then as his thought swept round man is so small but a fly on the wheel allingham would it disgust you if i read maud would you expire as he read he cried this is what was called namby pamby thats wonderfully fine and so on but it is carlyle as usual if we are to choose whose sentences cut from the context and dulled by time still burn brightest it is sometimes the obverse side of him that shows when for example allingham stands at the door and carlyle is heard from within go away sir i can do nothing with you but for the most part he was generous and accessible and lavish of his uncompromising judgments shelley had not the least poetic faculty i never could read anything he wrote it was all a shriek merely of swinburne there is not the least intellectual value in anything he writes whistler was the most absurd creature on the face of the earth of whitman it is as though the town bull had learnt to hold a pen but of shakespeare the longer i live the higher i rate that much belauded man and he described like an imaginative child as george eliot said the murmur that went up in the theatre when othello was played the voices of the men rising in your imagination like a red mountain with the womens voices floating round it like blue vapour it is curious to read that he judged sartor a book of very little value and cared most for his cromwell but the volume might yield many more stories than those we have taken and most of them are true in the best sense of the word how often in the future biographers will come here who want to know exactly what carlyle said of browning or how it was that he disposed of his old pipes an index makes all these facts available and the book has several interesting portraits from the brush of mrs allingham the sentimental traveller it is perhaps the confession of a narrow spirit but have we not heard a little too much lately about this pervasive genius loci nature has innumerable beauties and defects the smallest congregation of cottages is of profound significance and the more we feel this or see how it can be felt the more we resent the incessant evocation by one writer after another of a spirit that we believe to be in its purity both remote and austere vernon lee who gives us the sentimental traveller in particular boasts the utmost familiarity with this demon she looks out of a train window or parts her bedroom curtains of a morning and the picture compounded partly from the shape of the land partly from such expression as human habitation has given it composes itself at once but this is the bodily form only in which the genius manifests itself the spirit of the sight travels everywhere and wakens echoes in her mind of people of her childhood of music of books or perhaps she is led by it to consider some deep question of life or morality her method then so far as the portrait of the place is concerned is purely impressionist for if she were to concentrate her mind upon the task of seeing any object as exactly as it can be seen there would be no time for these egotistical diversions and who but pedants and antiquaries want to know when a palace was built or the exact style of its architecture to separate herself emphatically from such worthies she will indulge in quite gratuitous ambiguities to the earlier greeks navigating the dangerous adriatic the sun sets visibly among the seagirt cones hence phaeton icarus and geryon who if you remember was in some manner connected with the hesperides z the dots are a characteristic device and part of an artistic system that prevails throughout if only in travelling you will open your mind to receive all impressions and force your imagination to track down the most fugitive of suggestions something charming and valuable because original will be recorded this is perhaps the course that any sensitive mind adopts naturally though it does not always go on to trace it out upon paper but what art is needed to give such perishable matter an enduring form the art of charles lamb or of henry james vernon lee with much of the curiosity the candour and the sensitiveness to trifles of the true essayist lacks the exquisite taste and penetrating clearness of sight which make some essays concentrated epitomes of precious things such phrases as that bathingplace of dim napoleonic grecianpilaster and lyrebackedchair fashionableness or the poor pomatumlocked faintly moustachioed waspwaisted grandson attempt to snatch the essential but they surely light on something quite different or when the process is reversed and a waistcoat button is made the centre of branching avenues of thought do we feel that they strike inevitably from the spot of heat in the middle that he goethe should have brought back just this basket seems so human and touching opening vistas of the kind of memories he like some others among us would clutch at mornings in verona marketplace and such like or perhaps that is slipshod thinking and if it does stumble on the truth we feel inclined to congratulate ourselves on the accident the question as to what exactly distinguishes the truth from the falsehood in such work is a delicate one and the value of the book depends entirely upon our immediate certainty this is precisely right we can hardly appeal to any standard but that of our own taste in such matters why for instance does an image like the following satisfy us that melancholy sunset the smell of tornup seaweed and wet sands has always remained in my mind as symbolical of a souls shipwreck when the comparison that follows between the shellfish and the human beings seems altogether forced and unimaginative of such quivering slime we also are made up and our microscopic realities steep in our living liquids as these creatures in the sea perhaps the most satisfactory essays in the book are those that treat of real people for their characters are more profoundly realised and are not too fragile to stand a delicate and sure examination thomas hood at the same time that keats and lamb were writing there flourished so thick that even men like these showed little higher than the resta whole forest of strenuous and lusty human beings journalists artists or people simply who happened to live then and rear their children what profuse clamour what multitudinous swarms of life a wise biographer can call up for us from fields long since shorn and flat if he will take for his subject one of these mortals it is really bewildering for a moment to consider a student of letters is so much in the habit of striding through the centuries from one pinnacle of accomplishment to the next that he forgets all the hubbub that once surged round the base how keats lived in a street and had a neighbour and his neighbour had a family the rings widen infinitely how oxford street ran turbulent with men and women while de quincey walked with ann and such considerations are not trivial if only because they had their effect upon things that we are wont to look upon as isolated births and to judge therefore in a spirit that is more than necessarily dry mr jerrolds life of thomas hood gives rise to a number of such reflections both because he has written with delightful good taste and discrimination and because his subject after all belonged almost the whole of him to the race of the mortals if it had not been for his two or three poems perhaps he would have sunk with the rest of them with the load of albums and annuals and their makers or would have survived as some halfmythical comic figure the father of a few good stories and the author of innumerable puns there is even something nugatory about the facts of his life they suggest in the easy ordinary way in which they fit and succeed each other that there were hundreds of thomas hoods sons of middleclass parents apprenticed to engravers with a turn for writing verse or prose kindly domestic young men who if they did take to letters their parents were well advised in dissuading them would make no mark there but fill endless columns satisfactorily such to a great extent was the life of hood but there was just that exaggeration of temper or fortune in it that made him while he was one of a class typical of it also he was impelled by his gifts and his failings to travel the whole course that slighter men trod partly until he achieved something significant and completed his symbol as a boy he showed an abnormal facility if he went away on a holiday he sent home profuse letters full of descriptions already the surface show of life tickled him with its incongruities and at a time when most boys are aping some older writer he was simply observing with a lively eye what went on round him and scribbling it down in sheets of fresh easy prose he laughed at his fellow lodgers or stood at the window and took off the people whom he saw passing on their way to church the study of character i mean of amusing ones i enjoy exceedingly he wrote when he was sixteen and in the same spirit he dashed off a long poem on the town of dundee in imitation of the new bath guide no one could doubt where his gift would lead him in spite of the engraving and when he was twentytwo some papers accepted by the london magazine definitely determined him as mr jerrold thinks to trust entirely to his pen from that time onward his life was the complex life of a busy journalist there was no respite scarcely any partition for where are we to seek the events of his life but in his writings and when we read him we must remember his wife and children his illhealth the ceaseless pressure of money cares if a particular style pleased the public he must continue it though the mood was spent and as his first success was made in the whims and oddities he had still as he says to breathe his comic vein could hood at his moment have taken some editorial appointment writes mr jerrold we might have had more of his best and less of that journeyman work that is a very moderate statement of the regret that bursts from our lips at many stages of this panting harddriven career but in our desire to round the picture to possess our tragedy are we not inclined to fall into the fallacy to which thackeray gave shape in his paper on a joke i once heard from the late thomas hood he speaks of the grinning and tumbling through sorrow through exile poverty fever depression the sad marvellous picture of courage of honesty of patient endurance of duty struggling against pain until in our compassion we forget very likely the true spirit of the man his exuberance and brilliancy the odd vulgar humour of a cockney life the practical jokes and the supper parties o hood hood you do run on so exclaimed poor mrs hood half inarticulate at one of these feasts the very fact that he gave himself with such pliancy to the drudgery of a journalists life proves that there was something in the nature of his gift and temperament akin to it and when we turn to his writing we can surely discover there signs not only of work pumped out but of ideas springing gladly to the surface at the cheerful command of throbbing presses and fast falling sheets no other invitation could have sounded quite so aptly to a man with a brain full of puns but it is largely on account of these puns we are told that hood is now so little read indeed the portent is one that strikes the attention directly and it must be held to typify something fundamental in the constitution of his mind for his puns divide themselves into two classes or degrees the greater part of them are simply happy matchings of sound in which there is so thin a burden of meaning that the contrast is almost purely verbal alas theyve taken my beau ben to sail with old benbow but there are others in which the pun is the result of some strange association in hoods mind of two remote ideas which it is his singular gift to illustrate by a corresponding coincidence of language even the bright extremes of joy bring on conclusions of disgust like the sweet blossoms of the may whose fragrance ends in must these lines are taken from one of his most serious poems that on melancholy and serve to illustrate compactly a remarkable tendencyperhaps it is the remarkable tendency of his thought they show how the original leaning of his mind was really to wild and incongruous associations grotesque and monstrous conceits not in words only but in human life such as those we see so strikingly displayed in poems like eugene aram the haunted house and the last man and also we may discover a certain superficiality of conception which suffers him to find such contrasts as the verbal one of may and must adequate and makes him so supersensitive to the surface inflections of language as he was sensitive to the influence of contemporary writers the influence of lamb is clear in his prose of keats in his verse and coleridge one may guess affected his thought more deeply then either from these poems sir francis burnand has lately published in the red letter library a selection which gives a fair representation of the different moods in which hood sang they are broadly farcical or romantic or satirical or wildly fantastical and there are the two famous poems which admirers of hood will scarcely classify at all except by calling them inspired the song of the shirt in particular makes sir francis positively disinclined to dwell upon any other serious poems of hoods be it even the bridge of sighs and he has some quarrel with thackeray for the way in which he dwelt upon hoods perverse love of comicalitiesiz he points out that it was the jesting that paid and that hood was forced to make an income but what perhaps is overlooked is the necessary relationship between hoods fun and hoods tragedy you could not have the one without the other if he laughed in this way he must cry in that and the faults which we find in this light verse surely reproduce themselves in his serious poems thus the reason why we cannot with deference to sir francis burnand accept the song of the shirt as an enduring masterpiece is because of the slight cheapness of effect tending to the melodramatic which has something in common with the verbal dexterity the supersensitive surface of mind already noticed such lines as sewing at once with a double thread a shroud as well as a shirt or a little weeping would ease my heart but in their briny bed my tears must stop for every drop hinders needle and thread go straight as he says to our hearts but not to the noblest part of them ruth or the death bed touches a higher note you must honour and pity so fine a nature so honest and brilliant a mind stung now to impulsive and passionate utterance by the sorrows of the world now to irrepressible showers of merriment by its oddities but in the most solid of his work the sharp blade of his own circumstance is always wearing through you do not find all of him in his work you rise from it unsatisfied to ask what were the accidents of his life that made him write so mr jerrolds book then is a valuable addition to our knowledge of hood and any one who has had occasion to consult the memorials by his son and daughter will perceive at once how much all readers in the future must be indebted to mr jerrolds laborious research and good judgment a life was needed and he has provided it the memoirs of sarah bernhardt there are good reasons why when an actress promises to give us her memoirs we should feel an unusual interest and excitement even she lives before us in many shapes and in many circumstances the instrument of this passion and of that meanwhile if we choose to remember it she also sits in passive contemplation some little way withdrawn in an attitude which we must believe to be one of final significance it might be urged that it is the presence of this contrast that gives meaning to the most trivial of her actions and some additional poignancy to the most majestic we know too that each part she plays deposits its own small contribution upon her unseen shape until it is complete and distinct from its creations at the same time that it inspires them with life and when she undertakes to show us what manner of woman this has become should we not feel an exceptional gratitude and an interest that is more than usually complex perhaps no woman now alive could tell us more strange things of herself and of life than sarah bernhardt it is true that when she comes to this final act of revelation she makes use of certain conventions poses herself with greater care than we could wish before she allows the curtain to rise but that too is characteristic and to drop all metaphor her book surely should do what none of her parts has done and show us what cannot be shown upon the stage she was brought up in the convent of grands champs at versailles and her life at once forms itself into separate and brightly coloured beads they succeed each other but they scarcely connect she was so intensely organised even then that there were explosions when she came into contact for the first time with hard things in the world outside her when she was confronted by the sad walls of the convent she exclained papa papa i wont go to prison this is a prison i am sure but at that moment a little round short woman came out veiled to the mouth after she had talked for a time she saw that sarah was trembling and with some strange instinct she raised her veil wholly for a second i then saw the sweetest and merriest face imaginable i flung myself at once into her arms her actions within the walls were as sudden and as passionate her hair for example grew thick and curled and the sister who had to comb it in the early morning tugged callously i flung myself upon her and with feet teeth hands elbows head and indeed all my poor little body i hit and thumped yelling at the same time the pupils and the sisters came running they muttered their prayers and waved their holy signs at a distance until the mother prefect had recourse to a further charm and dashed a spray of holy water over the active devil of sarah bernhardt but after all this spiritual display it was the good mother superior with her sure instinct for effect who conquered by no more potent charm than an expression of pity but such tempers were partly the result of the extreme fragility of her health it is more significant to read how she built up for herself the reputation of a personality among her fellows she carried about with her little boxes full of adders and crickets and lizards the lizards generally had their tails broken for in order to see whether they were eating she would lift the lid and let it fall sharply red with surprise at their assurance in rushing forwards and crac there was nearly always a tail caught so while the sister taught she was fingering the severed tails and wondering how she could fasten them on again then she kept spiders and when a child cut her finger come at once i would say i have some fresh spider web and i will wrap your finger in it with such strange crafts and passions for she was never good at her books she touched the imagination and of course all this intensity of feeling went in the convent to paint some beautiful dramatic picture in which she acted the chief part as the nun who had renounced the world or the nun who lay dead beneath a heavy black cloth while the candles flared and the sisters and pupils cried out in delightful agony you saw o lord god she prayed that mamma cried and that it did not affect me for i adored my mother but with a touching and fervent desire to leave her to sacrifice her to god but a violent escapade which ended in a bad illness finished the religious career that promised so well she left the convent and though she still cherished only one ambition to take the veil it was decided in the most casual fashion in a remarkable family council to send her to the conservatoire her mother an indolent charming woman with mysterious eyes and heart disease and a passion for music who was at any rate no ascetic was in the habit of assembling relations and advisers when any family business had to be transacted on this occasion there were present a notary a godfather an uncle an aunt a governess a friend from the flat above and a distinguished gentleman the due de morny most of these people sarah had some reason to hate or to love he had red hair planted in his head like couch grass he called me ma fil he was gentle and kind and occupied a high place at court they discussed whether with the francs which her father had left her it would not be best to find her a husband but upon this she flew into a passion and cried ill marry the bon dieu i will be a nun i will and grew red and confronted her enemies they murmured and expostulated and her mother began to talk in a clear drawling voice like the sound of a little waterfall ji finally the due de morny was bored and rose to go do you know what you ought to do with this child he said you ought to send her to the conservatoire the words as we know were to have tremendous consequences but it is worth while to consider the whole scene apart from them as an example of that curious gift which gives to so many passages in this autobiography the precision and vitality of coloured and animated photographs no emotion that could express itself in gesture or action was lost upon her eye and even though such incidents had nothing to do with the matter in hand her brain treasured them and could if necessary use them to explain something it is often something quite trivial but for that reason perhaps almost startling in its effect thus the little sister was sitting on the floor plaiting the fringe of the sofa mme guerard came in without a hat she was wearing an indoor gown of indienne with a design of little brown leaves later a little drama is given thus my godfather shrugged his shoulders and getting up left the box banging the door after him mamma losing all patience with me proceeded to review the house through her operaglasses mile de brabender passed me her handkerchief for i had dropped mine and dared not pick it up that perhaps may be taken as a simple example of the way in which it is natural for an actress be she only twelve years old to see things it is her business to be able to concentrate all that she feels into some gesture perceptible to the eye and to receive her impressions of what is going on in the minds of others from the same tokens also the nature of her gift becomes increasingly obvious as the memoirs proceed and the actress matures and takes her station at this point of view and when as is here the case the alien art of letters is used to express a highly developed dramatic genius some of the effects that it produces are strange and brilliant and others pass beyond this limit and become grotesque and even painful on the way back from her examination at the conservatoire in which she had been successful she prepared a scene for her mother she was to enter with a sad face and then when her mother exclaimed i told you so she was to cry i have passed but the faithful madame guerard spoilt the effect by shouting the true story in the courtyard i must say that the kind woman continued so long as she lived to spoil my effects so that before beginning a story or a game i used to ask her to go out of the room not seldom we find ourselves in the same position as madame guerard although perhaps we might be able to offer an excuse there are two stories out of a bewildering variety which will serve to show how it is that sarah bernhardt sometimes crosses the boundary and becomes either ludicrous or painful or is it that we like madame guerard should leave the room after her astonishing exertions in the francoprussian war she felt the need of a change and went accordingly to brittany i adore the sea and the plain but i neither care for mountains nor for forests they crush me and stifle me in brittany she found horrid precipices set in the infernal noise of the sea and rocks to crawl beneath which had fallen there in unknown ages and were only held in equilibrium by some inexplicable cause there was a crevasse also the enfer du plogoff which she was determined to descend in spite of the mysterious warnings of her guide accordingly she was lowered by a rope attached to a belt in which additional holes had to be pierced for her waist was then but fortythree centimetres it was dark and the sea roared and there was a din as of cannons and whips and the howling of the damned at last her feet touched ground the point of a little rock in a swirl of waters and she looked fearfully about her suddenly she saw that she was observed by two enormous eyes a little further and she saw another pair of eyes i saw no body to these beings i thought for a minute that i was losing my senses she tugged violently and was slowly raised the eyes were lifted up also and while i mounted through the air i saw nothing but eyes everywhere eyes throwing out long feelers to reach me those are the eyes of the shipwrecked ones said her guide crossing himself i knew very well that they were not the eyes of shipwrecked ones but it was only at the hotel that i heard about the octopus it might puzzle a scrupulous chronicler to assign their original parts in this drama to the octopus the fisherman and to sarah bernhardt for the others it does not matter then again my dear governess mile de brabender was dying and she went to visit her she had suffered so much that she looked like a different person she was lying in her little white bed a little white cap covering her hair her big nose was drawn with pain her washedout eyes seemed to have no colour in them her formidable moustache alone bristled up with constant spasms of pain besides all this she was so strangely altered that i wondered what had caused the change i went nearer and bending down kissed her gently i then gazed at her so inquisitively that she understood instinctively with her eyes she signed to me to look on the table near her and there in a glass i saw all my dear old friends teeth there is one quality that most of the stories she tells have in common they are clearly the productions of a very literal mind she will accumulate fact upon fact multiply her octopuses indefinitely in order to achieve her effect but she will never invoke any mystical agency how could one manage the souls of the drowned all the vast unconscious forces of the world the width of the sky and the immensity of the sea she crinkles together into some effective scenery for her solitary figure it is for this reason that her gaze is so narrow and so penetrating and although her convictions as an artist hardly enter these pages it may be guessed that something of her unmatched intensity on the stage comes from the capacity which she shows for keen and sceptical vision where character is concerned she is under no illusions i had played badly looked ugly and been in a bad temper one figures her the most practical of women when she chooses a cheapener of fowls with the best of them who will only suffer herself to be cheated from the same cynicism with which no doubt she would cheat herself if she wished it for so clear an insight does not seem in her case at least consistent with a very exalted view of her kind if she had it by nature she may have found that it would not lend itself easily to the resources of her art that the effects to be got by it were uncertain and it is her glory to make any sacrifice that her art demands certainly when you have read some way in the book you become aware of a hardness and limitation in her view which perhaps may be accounted for by the fact that all these violent scenes are the result of certain wellcontrived explosions which serve but to illumine the curious face so unlike any other face of the actress and in a world thus lit for us in lurid bursts of violet and crimson light the one figure in all its poses is always vivid enough but the others which fall just outside the circle are strangely discoloured thus she saved a lady from falling downstairs on board ship who murmured in a voice that was scarcely audible i am the widow of president lincoln a thrill of anguish ran through me her husband had been assassinated by an actor and it was an actress who prevented her from joining her beloved husband i went to my cabin and stayed there two days and what was mrs lincoln feeling meanwhile such a multiplication of crude visible objects upon our senses wearies them considerably by the time the book is finished but what we suffer it is the final triumph of the personality is exhaustion and not boredom even the stars when she draws her curtain at night shine not upon the earth and the sea but upon the new era which her second volume will reveal to us also with our eyes dazzled by this unflinching stare we are urged to say something of the revelation and vainly no doubt for the more you are under the obsession of a book the less of articulate language you have to use concerning it you creep along after such shocks like some bewildered animal whose head struck by a flying stone flashes with all manner of sharp lightnings it is possible as you read the volume to feel your chair sink beneath you into undulating crimson vapours of a strange perfume which presently rise and enclose you entirely and then they draw asunder and leave clear spaces still shot with crimson in which some vivid conflict goes forward between bright pigmies the clouds ring with high french voices perfect of accent though so strangely mannered and so monotonous of tone that you hardly recognise them for the voices of human beings there is a constant reverberation of applause chafing all the nerves to action but where after all does dream end and where does life begin for when the buoyant armchair grounds itself at the end of the chapter with a gentle shock that wakes you and the clouds spin round you and disappear does not the solid room which is suddenly presented with all its furniture expectant appear too large and gaunt to be submerged again by the thin stream of interest which is all that is left you after your prodigal expense yes one must dine and sleep and register ones life by the dial of the clock in a pale light attended only by the irrelevant uproar of cart and carriage and observed by the universal eye of sun and moon which looks upon us all we are told impartially but is not this a gigantic falsehood are we not each in truth the centre of innumerable rays which so strike upon one figure only and is it not our business to flash them straight and completely back again and never suffer a single shaft to blunt itself on the far side of us sarah bernhardt at least by reason of some such concentration will sparkle for many generations a sinister and enigmatic message but still she will sparkle while the rest of us is the prophecy too arrogant lie dissipated among the floods the inward light an englishman travelling for business in burma fell from his pony and broke his leg the monks from the monastery above found him and laid him in a dim room and bound his head with leaves he slept and woke in peace and looked from his windows over a great valley and heard only the murmur of cattle and the cries of peasants down below and at dawn and sunset the melodious chant of gregorian prayers when his own people came to carry him away with them he begged to be left where he was telling them of all the things round him the fields the air the monks the children who sang that refreshed him and added i am quite happy indeed when he was recovered and could walk out in the country the simplest and most usual sights delighted and surprised him not only had they a fresh beauty of their own but he became aware that each plant or animal had in it a soul akin to his soul which made of the earth one coherent and harmonious whole to share in this gave a new meaning to life to live was good and then as readers of mr fielding halls works will expect the englishman of the present volume began to think why should this accidental stay at a wayside monastery so change the view of a mature man who had spent his life in various travel and effort and had achieved success again he resisted the invitation of hs friends to return to them and met their half scornful questioning with gentle but resolute replies he determined that he would set himself to learn the clearly visible faith which makes the eastern life so different from the western and decided that the fundamental difference was to be found in the consciousness which the burmese at least still cherish of the live presence the message of nature inspired with this belief he lived on in the midst of the people and put to them the questions that no european asks of another what is it you think of life what is mans soul the state of civilisation in which these questions are naked and urgent provides also an atmosphere of such clarity that very broad answers are possible in the same spirit mr fielding hall makes use again and again with gentle persistency of the old images life is a stream a wind it is a shaft of sunlight composed of separate beams indeed but you may not part them and bid one burn in the lamp and another in the grate it is a tide flowing in different measure but not in different kind through every living thing through plants and beasts and man and they are not units in themselves but fractions of infinity and must be joined to make one that is something of what people told him and of what was borne in upon him by the sight of their simple ways and the voice for such it became of the beautiful and happy world of nature he was further told in answer to his questioning that the soul of man had been evolved but the soul has a separate consciousness of its own which is not transmitted to the children of its body with their physical form what then happens to it is it merged in the wind no the monk shook his head it goes on for ever until until why should we wish to know a steamer coming up the river soon afterwards a myriadjewelled water creature breasting the stream provided the parable of the lamp with the light in it which it put out and the energy that made it goes who knows where tout lasse tout casse tout passe et tout renait such fragments of wisdom though expressed with all mr fielding halls usual charm of diction will never perhaps satisfy a mind which asks for counsel earnestly they are too vague too slight too humble but then as the author himself would urge he has never desired to impose the faith of this little people in their eastern valley upon the virile and indomitable west he is the first to recognise its limitations but also he is convinced of the value of certain qualities which he finds in the one belief and not in the other and as we are all concerned with the business of living though few consider it philosophically the impressions of so sensitive an observer have charm and value also there are it seems two distinguishing qualities in the burmese faith it makes them happy and it keeps them unafraid it teaches them that the life of the world from the beginning has been a continuous procession of all its parts towards the infinite light and that none of the attributes of life are important compared with the capacity for life which is in each for it is that the simple living in the midst of other live things that confers the supreme happiness thus they make no distinction between one class and another their sexes with different duties are of equal value no sharp division of creed or race can separate men who all breathe alike in order that you may realise the purity of this existence the better a european who has become a burman in religion without adopting their conception of the whole passes through one of their merry festivals and painfully disturbs it his face is sharp and white and sad he has come from a land where the faith is dry and formal as a thing enclosed in sealed vessels his soul cannot melt into the universal harmony it is a little nut within a changing kernel so when the famine came it found a meek and acquiescent victim in the race which had no fear of death famines come and go only the soul lasts on and when the englishman listened to the prayers of men and women tortured and left desolate he did not hear bitter words of revolt or hopeless words of submission but a peaceful sound like the murmur of the pigeons on the flags indeed the impression which the book leaves in part perhaps unconsciously is one of singular peace but also of singular monotony the continued metaphors in which their philosophy is expressed taken from the wind and light waters chains of bubbles and other sustained forces solve all personal energy all irregularity into one suave stream it is wise and harmonious beautifully simple and innocent but if religion is as mr hall defines it a way of looking at the world is this the richest way does it require any faith so high as that which believes that it is right to develop your powers to the utmost shelley and elizabeth hitchener lovers of literature have once more to thank mr dobell for discharging one of those patient and humble services which only true devotion will take the pains to perform shelleys letters to miss hitchener have already been printed indeed but privately and now we have them issued in a delightful shape enriched with an introduction and with notes by mr dobell himself so that one more chapter in the life of shelley becomes plainer and more substantial nor can it be objected that the piety in this instance is excessive for although the letters are chiefly remarkable because they illustrate the nature of a boy who was five or six years later to write consummate poetry still shelleys character is always amazing and in spite of the verbosity and the pale platitudes of his style in it is impossible to read the letters without an exquisite sense of faded scenes come to life again and dull people set talking and all the country houses and respectable sussex vicarages once more alive with ladies and gentlemen who exclaim what a shelley an atheist and add their weight to the intense comedy and tragedy of his life elizabeth hitchener was a schoolmistress at hurstpierpoint and shelley first knew her in when he was nineteen and she was twentyeight she was the daughter of a man who kept a public house and was or had been a smuggler and all her education was due to a mrs adams who is called in the language of the letters the mother of my soul miss hitchener was thin tall and dark an austere intellectual woman with a desire for better things than the society of a country village could afford her although she was not as shelley was eager to assure her a deist and a republican but she was probably the first clever woman he had met she was oppressed lonely misunderstood and in need of some one with whom she could discuss the pleasant agitations of her soul shelley rushed into the correspondence with enthusiasm and she no doubt though a little mystified and awkward in her flight was touched and anxious to prove herself as passionate as philanthropic and almost as revolutionary as he was shelleys first letter indicates the nature of the friendship he speaks of certain books which in the manner of ardent young men he had thrust upon her locke the curse of kehama and ensors national education he goes on to attack her christianity exclaims that truth is my god and ends up but see ensor on the subject of poetry it would be delightful if we could have miss hitcheners letters also for some allusions in shelleys answers show the way in which on occasion she would try to cap his speculations all nature she wrote but that of horses is harmonical and he is born to misery because he is a horse an ode on the rights of women began all all are men women and all but it is clear enough without her replies that shelley was not anxiously concerned with the state of her mind he assumed easily that she was of a more exalted temper than he was so that it was not necessary to investigate details but he might pour forth to her as to some impersonal deity the surprising discoveries and ardent convictions which come with such bewildering rapidity when for the first time the world asks a definite question and literature supplies a variety of answers the poor schoolmistress we can gather took vague alarm when she found to what a mate she had attached herself to what speculations she was driven what opinions she must embrace and yet there was a strange and not laughable exhilaration in it which urged her on the relationship moreover was soon justified by shelleys marriage with harriet westbrook and her approval of the correspondence it was to be a spiritual companionship in no way inspired by carnal love of that lump of organised matter which enshrines thy soul and further there was the insidious bait which shelley offered with his curious lack of humanity in the letter which explains why he married harriet he begged the sister of his soul to help him in educating his wife blame me for the marriage if thou wilt dearest friend for still thou art dearest to me yet pity even this error if thou blamest me miss hitchener it is clear was keenly susceptible to praise of her mind which so subtly implied a closer tie her letters became voluminous and showed so shelley declared the embryon of a mighty intellect but the prophetess kept one shrewd and sensible and it must be added honourable eye upon the earth she was well aware that harriet might become jealous nor could she disregard the mischievous chatter of cuckfield gossips and attend only as shelley bade her to the majestic approval of her conscience tragedy of a sordid and substantial kind was bound sooner or later to dissolve this incongruous alliance between the rushing poet whose wings grew stronger every day and the painstaking but closely tethered woman the illusion was only sustained because for so long shelley was in wales or cumberland or ireland and the lady remained at hurstpierpoint earning her living which was noble in itself and teaching small children which was yet nobler for to teach is to propagate intellect every error conquered every mind enlightened is so much added to the progression of human perfectibility then the first of the poets illusions was terribly destroyed hoggs treachery was discovered and poor shelley more in need than ever of understanding turned wholly to his almost only friend as he calls her in the letter which tells her of the blow his desire reiterated with the utmost emphasis was that elizabeth should join his wandering household directly and harriet in some of the most interesting letters in the volume was made to add her entreaty to his in a tone that tried with some pathos to imitate his enthusiasm and generosity but would lapse easily it is clear into plaintive commonsense when he was out of hearing miss hitchener for a long while declined for a variety of reasons she would have to give up her school her only support depend entirely on shelley defy her father and besides people would talk but these arguments coming on the top of so much impassioned rhetoric were inadmissible the hatred of the world shelley declared is despicable to you come come and share with us the noblest success or the most glorious martyrdom assert your freedom your pen ought to trace characters for a nations perusal whatever the reason she yielded at length and set off in july on her disastrous expedition to devonshire for a time all acted up to their high missions portia for elizabeth was already sacred to harriets sister discussed innate passions god christianity etc with shelley walked with him and condescended so far as to exchange the name portia which harriet did not like i had thought it would have been one more common and pleasing to the ear for bessy professor dowden gives us a singular picture of the time shelley and the tall dark woman who is taken by some for a maidservant wander on the shore together and set bottles and chests stuffed with revolutionary pamphlets floating out to sea uttering words of ecstatic prophecy over them within doors she wrote from his dictation and read as he directed but the decline of this artificial virtue was inevitable the women were the first to discover that the others were impostors and soon shelley himself veered round with childlike passion the spiritual sister and prophetess became simply the brown demon a woman of desperate views and dreadful passions who must be got rid of even at the cost of a yearly allowance of a hundred pounds it is not known whether she ever received it but there is a very credible tradition that she recovered her senses after her startling downfall and lived a respectable and laborious life at edmonton sweetened by the reading of the poets and the memory of her romantic indiscretions with the truest of them all the memoirs of lady dorothy nevill sometimes coming home at night through dark streets you may see vanishing round the corner the curved shape of a ghostly chariot it must be on its way surely to some brilliant festival where the lights have been out these hundred years but no the omnibus driver points too it is lord soandsos coach that great nobleman then has still the imagination to conceive himself properly conveyed down regent street on a muddy night in a swinging crystal box with angels adoring a coat of arms on the panels and two symbolical footmen erect behind him to ward off all the perils of the dark and it is a great achievement which deserves our gratitude for assuring ourselves that it is april shall we say in the year nineteen hundred and eight and that the white blaze among the trees over there is symbol of a royal court we may go on to indulge ourselves in a number of exquisite scenes shut hitherto between the covers of books when the chariot stays the serving men leap down and stand with uncovered heads as the lord and his lady step through them and into the great white hall hand in hand they mount the staircase and bow and curtsey and pass on leisurely into vast rooms clear as windswept skies where the ladies have space to spread their trains like peacocks and the lords toy gently with their silver swords other couples and groups swim past them until the floor as the family portraits look down upon it is a beautiful pattern of moving colours which never stay or crowd but circle easily in and out as though they trod the measure of a stately dance but there is an inner room where there are gilt chairs on a polished floor and one or two brocaded sofas a wood fire burns clearly and there are innumerable soft candles here sitting lightly upright we find some score perhaps of ladies and gentlemen who have no other occupation it seems but the use of their tongues and what talk it is each speaks with confidence and with an indescribable air of ease and dignity commingled as though after rolling wisdom for five centuries in the brain it issued at length in smooth drops bright as silver but ponderous with purpose the prime minister there unfolds the future of england for the inspection and correction of a certain sagacious dowager with a fan here a brilliant youth explodes with paradoxes that are to become laws and here again one pulls a blotted sheet from his shirt frill and reads while all listen gravely poems that sound like keats a lady quotes sappho in the greek and another flashes with inspired epigram what was it for the words escape us but lady dorothy nevill should be able to repeat them it is the only consolation indeed of one forced to see buckingham palace from the outside and to people it within from the novels of mrs humphry ward perhaps that the aristocrat will nowadays grant us a reflection of his privileges by means of his pen otherwise the stout walls of their parks the locked doors of their galleries would be intolerable to any one possessed of pen and ink or dynamite but memoirs in the past have led us to believe that by refraining from such violence we cherish certain sanctuaries where all that is highminded and witty and fair can live happily and for the credit of the race it seems good that a handful of us should grow up with greek statues round us titians on our walls spacious gardens to walk in time for reading and music and talk lady dorothy as she is proud to tell you has an indisputable right to all these privileges for she is the daughter of lord orford and for many generations a walpole has succeeded a walpole at the family seat in norfolk in her two volumes of memoirs she confirms all that we have imagined of the aristocratic life but with this qualification it exists no longer in the forties and the fifties of the last century society was a real thing and with melancholy pride she writes of the brilliant days and contrasts them with the ugly respectable life which has replaced them courtesy and good humour distinguish her naturally she will try to see that there is some good in the change but pathetically enough her native instincts are always asserting themselves society in the old days cannot in any way be compared with the motley crowd that calls itself society today the general level of conversation in the so called society of modern days must of necessity be low for society or what passes for it is now very large whilst wealth is more welcome than intellect good conversation therefore is practically nonexistent in the old days society was very small for birth was the first qualification then it followed that they all knew each other so that it was more like a large family than anything else and then though this seems less a matter of human than of divine arrangement that they were all endowed with powers of intellect as rare as their blood but if you grant them these gifts and conceive that they have no ulterior object beyond intelligent cultured and dignified enjoyment as lady dorothy puts it you do indeed imagine such a society as that of athens in the time of pericles or paris in the time of madame recamier and our belief in the virtues of our own british aristocracy is splendidly fulfilled but when we come to read the account of what they said something is it time that has done it or print or is our taste too plebeian something at any rate is not as it should be for having arranged the whole scene enthusiastically according to lady dorothys directions and set noble men and women eating their oysters with knives or toying with a dish of homegrown truffles beneath a shower of prismatic glass in the great diningroom in berkeley square we listen to the talk which as lady dorothy tells us people could talk then after an awful pause we hear miss gordon cumming raise her voice i beg to call the attention of the company to the very lucid interval between novars waistcoat and his trousers munro of novar it must be said was very unconventional in his attire this utterance naturally provoked uproarious laughter then bernal osborne an autocrat of the dinnertable at which his sway was practically unquestioned utters those brilliant but bitter personalities which delighted a society where all were friends he nicknames one grave and dignified politician the highstepping hearse horse of a somewhat colourless character he says he has no affections at all except rheumatic ones a political opponent with a slight twist in the neck he calls the man with the tyburn face a creature who had been imperfectly operated upon this display of wit may continue throughout a meal unchecked or some unfortunate lady who is only invited because she is rich may quote french delightfully badly and again perhaps provoke uproarious laughter no one so far as we can discover of natural rather than hereditary gifts ever found his way into these diningrooms although lady dorothy assures us that the old leisured aristocracy delighted in gathering together people of conversational power and for this reason alone certain individuals whose sole credentials were their wit and mental cultivation were accorded a place in society there were several such men of whose origin nothing was known or asked so that we must lay the blame on the clever men themselves did they ask questions then and if so what answer would they get and with lady dorothys volumes for text we must admit that the answer returned to our anxious questioning is a strange one it is very natural that writing of the past she should write with regret and wit as every one knows is perishable but there is ample room in the space of two large volumes for something far more illuminating than a dozen obsolete epigrams nor has she failed to construct round these poor tarnished little scenes a substantial edifice it is in the strangeness the audacity the combined airiness and solidity of this conception that we must find the real value of her book and the answer to our question for life is not merely a matter of dinner parties there are the lower classes country houses politics and the arts in order that you may have a society such as that which she laments all these surroundings must be properly arranged in due relation to it we must begin at the beginning with the farmer people she writes were merry in those days the thirties and forties many of my fathers tenants had held the same farm for generations and all of them were imbued with great reverence for the old families a robust kind of sympathy existed between the lord and his tenant bred of dependence on the one side benevolence on the other which was comfortable and picturesque they drew your carriage home for you on occasions of joy and loaded the hall with cream of their own making on your marriage day innumerable customs and crafts still lingered in the pretty old villages which the great lady loved to encourage before the board schools came with their smatterings of many totally useless subjects and destroyed the delightful practice for example of the art of buttony there were still old chairs and tables to be picked up for ridiculously small sums in the country farms and dignified and spiritual traditions still flourished in illiterate minds the whipping of the bounds was continued and once even but this was in happier days an elder sister was obliged to dance in a hogs trough should the younger sister marry before her with this superficial rearrangement it is clear that life becomes far more amusing directly it is so full of charming nooks and corners in which superstitions and gallantries may lodge themselves and pic turesque inequality breaks up everywhere the monotony of plain human life but after all this is no more than a pleasant disposition of the little village outside the park gates and the heart of the whole matter is to be found within how does lady dorothy approach her equals i have always been much interested in art and artistic people i do not mean the kind of art which is associated with affectation and oleaginous pedantry but the cult of what is curious and beautiful and interesting at different times i have collected all sorts of things and attempted nearly all kinds of amateur work including book illumination leather working wood carving and of late years a kind of oldfashioned leather work it is this sublimely insolent disrespect for art that vitiates the whole of the structure for surely it is fatal if you are an aristocrat not to honour the only people who have imagination enough to believe in your beauty and piecing together one phrase with another the jests and opinions and habits what an astonishing erection it is she has collected watch papers and wedding rings and bills and old buttons she has surrounded herself with odds and ends of furniture in all styles she has bred silkworms and imported crayfish she has visited innumerable picture galleries and said how dyou do to half the distinguished names in england rare dogs and strange birds and gifted men have amused her and paid her compliments but why does the book in spite of all these diversions fill us with depression as though on a rainy day we had lost ourselves in some dingy and rambling old house crowded with ornaments and frivolous in spite of its age it is partly because it is so solid still in appearance and formidable with all the furniture of life and partly because whatever genuine test you apply to it it goes to pieces directly if you were so rash as to quote keats there an almost visible struggle would go on for a moment between the words and the atmosphere alarming as a sudden precipice in a meadow and afterwards the house is more shabby and less beautiful than ever as though lightning had singed it but lightning is rare and such establishments continue to send their smoke up placidly enough in all the counties of england and perhaps melancholy as the conclusion is do no great harm to anybody wordsworth letters we have at last in three stout volumes a collection of wordsworths letters including those already published and scattered in many books some freshly discovered and a number written by his sister his wife and one or two near relatives as well as the work progressed says professor knight it became increasingly evident that no new life of wordsworth was needed it might be well as he suggests that some one in the future should condense them and compose out of so much fresh matter a fresh picture of the writer but he fears unfortunately that he must leave that task to a successor in the meantime lovers of wordsworth owe him their thanks for his labour and in default of the arrangement of a master hand must rejoice in the noble mass of material here given over to them but in what sense can it be said as professor knight says that few of his contemporaries and none of his fellow poets revealed themselves more fully than wordsworth did in his letters he loathed we know the labour of penmanship nor did his mind take naturally to the epistolary form we never get from him the impression which the great letterwriters lamb or fitzgerald or mrs carlyle give us that the scene which they have in their mind is precisely fit for a sheet of letter paper and that it is a keen delight to smooth it out there wordsworth addressed himself to his task reluctantly always under other compulsion than his own and often with audible groans at that which had become a necessity but the result is that nothing is uttered without urgent need for utterance there is no frivolity or ornament and the letters accumulate upon the imagination in a solid mass and leave there a monument of his mind and nature monotonous and monolithic indeed but impressive as an authentic building where every stone has been lifted laboriously to its place by the poets own hand the letters again cover a long stretch of years from to and must be held therefore to give the amplest possible comment upon his life the three volumes should illustrate continuously the three periods of effort and achievement and repose but though with his poems before us we are able to arrange some such division there is curiously little in the letters themselves to confirm it a young man who is to lead the great poetic revolution of his age who meets for the first time with other young men of equal genius and with views that correspond with his should one conceives write the most interesting letters in the language but when we turn to one of the letters printed here for the first time written in and to coleridge our expectations are sublimely if ludicrously brushed aside dorothy is now sitting by me racked with toothache the chimney smokes they have hired a woman to wash the dishes we could have had this attendance for eighteenpence a week but we added the sixpence for the sake of the poor woman i feel little disposed to notice what you say of lyrical ballads and when he does deal with matters of prime interest to them both it is with the judicial discretion of middle age when it is considered what has already been executed in poetry it is strange that a man cannot perceive particularly when the present tendencies of society are observed that it is the time when a man of genius may honourably take a station upon different ground epigram or any unpremeditated utterance which strikes the mind as though red hot is not to be found in this cautious record of daily life and accumulating experience and though there are some terse criticisms of writers walpole is that cold and falsehearted frenchified coxcomb carlyle and emerson write a language which they suppose to be english yet we have his own word for it that he never felt inclined to write criticism but although it would be easy enough by quotation to establish the view that wordsworth when he was not inspired had the mind of a country clergymans wife that is a piece of impertinence which the succession of the letters completely crushes out of existence the revelation which they make is so comprehensive that at the very moment when he shows you something petty or commonplace you become aware of the vast outline surrounding it majestic and indifferent to your sneers when we expect rhapsody and poetry we find instead careful reckoning of income or wise plans for the education of the family left by the death of both parents in a precarious state but we get also such words as those which dorothy uses of her brother when he was twentythree he has she wrote a violence of affection which demonstrates itself every moment of the day in a sort of restless watchfulness which i know not how to describe a tenderness that never sleeps and their companionship so equal so simple and so sincere continued throughout their lives is beautifully apparent every letter hints at the exquisite relationship they walk together notice the same buds and clouds read at the same table and dorothy when she has given her criticisms bids him in fine words trust the rest to posterity his writing will live is her valiant assertion when we and our little cares are all forgotten the impression left by the long letters to mathews wrangham or sir george beaumont is of a writer compelled to turn aside for a moment from a sight of absorbing interest he will concentrate his mind upon his task give advice sympathy or information but all the while he is engrossed in the country outside the window and the stern and sufficient life which he has shaped in harmony with it again and again he considers the perplexed lives of his friends coleridge or de quincey and sums up the position with the utmost sagacity do your duty to yourself immediately he bids de quincey love nature and books seek these and you will be happy he is not blind for a moment to the disastrous weakness underlying the splendid powers of coleridge but exposes it with the melancholy insight of a physician i give it you as my deliberate opinion formed upon proofs that have been strengthening for years that he neither will nor can execute anything of important benefit to himself his family or mankind and yet nothing shakes his belief in coleridges powers no one upholds with greater reverence the sanctity of genius or believes more profoundly in the immeasurable virtue of poetry this constant faith kindles all these sober judgments the sheets of political pessimism the elaborate instructions for the laying out of a garden the minute description of colours and shapes on the hillside and unifying them proves them all so much fuel for the true fire of poetry to be incapable of a feeling for poetry in my sense of the word is to be without love of human nature and reverence for god this then is the source of the satisfaction which encompasses us as we read on with little humour or variety of mood to entice us there is no gulf between the stuff of daily life and the stuff of poetry save that one is the raw material of the other and the change is effected constantly even before our eyes things are lost in each other and limits vanish and aspirations are raised when he walks in london melancholy and very thoughtful he suddenly becomes aware that fleet street lies before him under snow silent empty and pure white i cannot say how much i was affected and what a blessing i felt there is in habits of exalted imagination my sorrow was controlled and seemed at once to receive the gift of an anchor of security there is arrogance in that perhaps but it is of the kind that makes us ask how we are to distinguish between a reverence for himself and a reverence for nature the pitch of a common life that permits these transitions is very high and when now and again he speaks of his own beliefs or his own unhappiness the words have a poignancy that reaches to the uttermost depths beautiful though we smile is the sense that comes over him abroad of his own irritability so that he must ask pardon of his wife at once dearest mary when i have felt how harshly i often demeaned myself to you while correcting the last edition of my poems i often pray to god that i may make some amends to you you have forgiven me i know as you did then and perhaps that somehow troubles me the more such feelings come frequently to mitigate with curious pathos the loneliness and austerity of his figure and assure us that at no point did he lose his power of living as he says in the midst of the realities of things metaphors rise constantly to the lips in thinking of him which shall express his majesty his serenity in the form of some enduring natural object a mountain or a river but it is the merit of the letters that they forbid impersonal abstractions noble as his life was they show it to be made of common stuff transmuted as he would have said into a permanent shape by the perfect sincerity of his ambition his daily life exposed to us here so largely and with such indifference to effect has thus the same quality that moves us in the deepest of his poems it points unswervingly through trials and obscurities to the most exalted end john delane if in the middle days of the last century you had seen the figure of a certain tall young man ruddy of complexion and powerful of build you might have foretold a dozen successful careers for him as squire lawyer or man of business but perhaps you would not have fitted him at once with his indubitable calling that spark of genius for surely it was not less flashed in the brain of john walter proprietor of the times when he saw the second son of a neighbour of his in the country riding to hounds or conducting a successful election on his behalf john thadeus delane went to oxford and distinguished himself there rather as a bold rider mr delane is part and parcel of his horse wrote his tutor a tennisplayer or a boxer for the hot irish blood in him would rise than as a nice scholar or a mathematician his letters to his friend george dasents show him something of a philistine with a command of vigorous and wholesome english lending itself happily to such casual remarks as those he had to make about his studies and his sports he did not know for instance how i am to cram a sufficient store of divinity into my head as the premises will only be occupied a short time with the lastnamed commodity the trouble of storing it should be slight i must try to secure a patent safety vehicle this is a most glorious country capital people excellent horses prime feeding and very fair shooting such is the slang of the forties which with its comfortable lapse from the dignity of contemporary prose reveals a young man lazily conscious of his power with a capacity for shooting words straight if need be and for distorting them at will which is the despair of lady novelists who seek to reproduce it directly he had taken his degree in he went to printing house square and was occupied with various duties about the paper little is said of their nature or of the way in which he discharged them for he had now entered that unnamed world which is crowded but unchecked there are duties which belong to no profession nor are the limits of work bounded so long as the brain urges on he made himself familiar with the house of commons we are told summarising the remarks of the principal speakers we must imagine how swiftly he took the measure of the world around him gauging silently the capacity of his machine for reporting and perhaps for directing the turmoil a year later at any rate when mr barnes the editor died mr walter had no hesitation in choosing the youngest member of all the staff whose age was then twentythree to succeed him sense and industry and ability were his but the easy margin of strength as of a loosely fitting coat which may be detected in his oxford letters marked him to a discriminating eye as the man who would put forth greater power than he had yet shown with a competent tool in his hand or would so weld himself to his instrument that their joint stroke would be irresistible but it is one of the mysteries that tempt us and baffle us in this biography that the transition is almost unmarked we hear mr delane exclaim once in tremendous spirits by jove john i am editor of the times but in future the editor and the times are one as in the old days the undergraduate was part of his horse what the condition of the paper was when he came to it or what private estimate he had formed of its scope we are not told but as all agree that the age of delane was the great age and that the paper grew with its editor we may believe that he undertook the task without articulate reflection conscious of a power within him that would soon fill all the space permitted it what i dislike about you young men of the present day is that you all shrink from responsibility he was wont to laugh when people wondered much of the papers industry as chronicler and reporter and simple publisher was merely that of a gigantic natural force sucking in and casting forth again its daily cloud of print impartially and the editor was lost in its shade but almost at once the brain of the monster which expressed itself daily in the four leading articles was given cause to show its quality there was a ministerial crisis and delane had not only to anticipate the rest of the world in publishing the news but to express an opinion no study were there material for it could be more fascinating than the analysis of such an opinion hawthorne himself might have found scope for all his imagination all his love of darkness and mystery in tracing it from its first secret whisper to its final reverberation over the entire land a great minister sends for the editor to his private room and speaks to him a note from someone who has picked up a word at court is left on him instantly with an audacity that may land him in disaster he fits the parts together and instructs his leaderwriter to embody them in a column of english prose tomorrow a voice speaks with authority in court and market and council chamber but whose voice is it it is not the voice of mr delane the urbane gentleman who rides along fleet street on his cob nor is it the voice of dr woodham the learned fellow of jesus it has the authority of government and the sting of independence downing street trembles at it and the people of england give ear to it for such is the voice of the times it is easy to submit to the fascination of the idea and to conceive a monster in printing house square without personality but with an infallible knowledge of persons ruthless as a machine and subtle as a single brain and there are facts in this book which seem to justify the most extravagant statement that we can make there is of course the romantic story of the times and the repeal of the corn laws we read also how louise philippe and guizot thought it worth their while to impede the papers correspondence how the tsar heard of the ultimatum of through the times and not through the foreign office how it was objected in the house of lords that cabinet secrets were made public and the times answered we are satisfied that it was useful to the public and to europe how the times foretold the indian mutiny and was the first to reveal the state of the army in the crimea how the times was foremost with the queens speech and with texts and resignations innumerable making ministries deciding policies exalting statesmen and casting them down the list might be lengthened but surely without avail for already there is some risk lest we grow beyond our strength and forget what these volumes should recall the character the individual will directing this giant force and placing its blows in such tender quarters his contemporaries certainly did not forget for it was the independence of the paper that was chiefly valuable or dangerous as fortune chanced and the spirit that preserved it from the blunt blow and shapeless mass of a machine was of course the spirit of mr delane together with these triumphs of organisation we read of other triumphs that are no less remarkable prime ministers and secretaries of state lay aside with relief one guesses their impassive public countenance and entrust mr delane not only with state secrets but with private prejudices of their own here was one with greater knowledge than the best instructed of ministers with whom no secrecy availed who was moreover so sequestered from the public eye that you might approach him without reserve as patients their physician or penitents their confessor a letter from lord palmerston begins t am told you disapprove i and goes on to justify his action with allusions to foreign politics and the gout which though each had a share in his behaviour would not have been used to explain it either to the public or to his friends the anonymity which delane took such care to preserve was no doubt of the utmost value in the conduct of the paper investing it with an impersonal majesty but there is reason to think that it came from no mere professional policy but was a deep seated instinct in the character of the man he was infinitely receptive and so far anonymous by nature that the broad columns of the times filled with the writing of other men but sharpened and guided by himself expressed all of him that he chose to express when he left his rooms in the morning he rode about london followed by a groom calling at the house of commons or at downing street and took his lunch with one great lady and his tea with another he dined out almost nightly and met frequently all the great nobles and celebrities of the time but his demeanour we are told was inscrutable he was of opinion that society should be exclusive and his attitude generally was one of observant silence he never mentioned the times after he had left the office though the paper was always in his thoughts at length when he had stored his mind with observations he returned to printing house square and with his energies at full play and his staff circling round him shaped the course of the paper in accordance with his own view until it was three or four in the morning and he must rest before the labours of the day and yet in spite of his silence his broad way of looking at tendencies and institutions rather than at individuals men and women we read gave him their confidences they were sure of able consideration from a man who had infinite experience of men but as it appears from his letters they were sure also of a massive integrity which inspired absolute trust both that he would respect your secret and that he would respect more than you or your secret what was right his letters however can seldom be said to add anything that the columns of the times have not already supplied but they are token again of the literal truth of his phrase when there was talk of his retirement all that was worth having of my life has been devoted to the paper there was not sufficient space between his professional life and his private life for any change of view or difference of code we may find in that fact some clue to the amazing authority which he wielded for it is easy to see that if you disproved some opinion of his or disparaged some method you aimed a blow at the nature of the man himself the two being of one birth when he travelled abroad and visited towns famous for their beauty or their art he was unconscious of their appeal but was inclined to adopt on such occasions the attitude of a portly gentleman with pretty children perhaps he had noticed some new factory or some stout bridge from the train window and had found in it the text of a leading article he travelled much and visited any place that might become the centre of action and in time of peace he went on pilgrimage through the great houses of england where the nerves of the country come nearest to the surface it was his purpose to know all that could be known of the condition and future of europe so far as certain great signs reveal it and if he ignored much there was no wiser or more discriminating judge of the symptoms he chose to observe one quality seems to mark his judgments and to add to their value they are so dispassionate the indifference he always showed to what was thought of him came naturally from his wellfounded trust in himself but there was another reason for it once or twice hinted in the course of this book and once at least outspoken the paper was more to him than his own fortunes and thus divested of personality he came to take a gigantic and even humorous view of the whole which sometimes seems to us sublime sometimes callous and sometimes when we read certain phrases near the end very melancholy he was the most attentive observer of the political life of his age but he took no part in it when he was attacked he gave with one exception no answer his anonymity his reticence no man was to take his portrait or to make him look ridiculous are allied surely with the casual bluntness of speech and indifference to praise or blame which gave his opinion its peculiar weight something like consternation prevailed at the war office and at the horse guards when it became known that delane intended to be present upon salisbury plain but could he have cared so much for the world for politics for the welfare of numbers had he not been indifferent to his personal share in it or again would he so soon have tired of the scene had some part of it touched him more nearly again and again the phrase recurs the new year found me as the last had done alone at printing house square and the loneliness deepened as life drew on until we find such a sentence as this nobody now his mother being dead cares about me or my success or my motives and that weariness of life i had long felt has been gaining on me ever since i have much to be thankful for but i have become so indifferent to life weary both of work and idleness careless about society and with failing interests but it would be unwise to allow such a sentence to set its seal upon the rest or to colour too sadly that colossal erection of courage and devotion which he called the paper his success only was tinged with a browner shade than it might otherwise have worn when he was middleaged he bought himself a tract of common near ascot and busied himself in reclaiming the land and in playing the farmer it is easy to see him there looking much like a country squire with the interests of his crops at heart as he rode about and drew in great draughts of the open air from the clods of earth and the watery english sky he received a passive satisfaction and came perhaps to enjoy an easier intercourse with these dumb things than with human beings the diary of a ladyinwaiting lady charlotte bury was the daughter of the fifth duke of argyllz and her beauty and her wit made her at once the talk of london when she came up to town in the last years of the eighteenth century but her head was full of romance and she preferred a marriage with her kinsman jack campbell who was handsome a great fellow but badly off to an alliance with some rich nobleman in england they lived in edinburgh for the most part and lady charlotte was queen of the literary society there scribbling her own verses and receiving the compliments of walter scott c k sharpe and monk lewis their circumstances however were never easy nine children were born to them and when she was thirtyfour her husband died and left her to bring them up as she might the natural profession for a woman with her connexions was about the court and it is characteristic of her that she sought service with the princess of wales with whom she had long sympathised although the princess was then in an uncomfortable situation separated from her husband and estranged from the royal family at the same time lady charlotte began to keep a diary and it is this work which is now reprinted with the omission of certain unnecessary parts and the addition of a great number of names which the discretion of previous editors thought fit to conceal beneath a dash as it is the size of the volumes is sufficiently formidable and were it not for the watery georgian atmosphere which they preserve we might wish that lady charlottes sentiments had been curtailed those evanescent emanations of spirit which are only cognisable to the very few and which thrive not unless under the influence of congenial feelings have fallen to continue her metaphor upon a barren soil and are withered by the cold blight of criticism the princess of waless court if it has a right to the name was a comfortless and incongruous place she kept up all the forms of royalty at kensington and blackheath but she was constantly meeting with some insolence from the great nobles and flouting them with an irresponsible outburst of wild spirits she would walk solemnly with her ladies in kensington gardens and suddenly bolt out at one of the smaller gates and walk all over bayswater and along the paddington canal asking at every door whether there were any houses to be let and chuckling at her own ingenuity some respectable people stood by her and gave her parties the semblance of dignity but as soon as these gentlemen left she felt a weight off her she calls it dull observes lady charlotte or in her own phrase mine gottl dat is de dullest person gott almighty ever did born and true enough the moralist proceeds good society is often dull brougham and whitbread were always coming with documents for her to sign and good advice for her to follow there was perpetual talk of policy whether she should go to the opera whether she should accept the regents terms or hold out for her own rights she was always acting on the spur of the moment and upsetting calculations that were not as lady charlotte guessed entirely disinterested they go over the whole story of her wrongs again and again at these dreary dinner parties and when that subject becomes intolerable she chatters about books or talks scandal wishes people dead or sings squall squall squall with the sapios for she loved to imagine herself the centre of a brilliant society lady charlotte had much to deplore from the first although her kind and sentimental heart was constantly touched by the poor ladys miseries the cause she guessed of much of her levity and she had sense enough to see that a little good management at this crisis might have invaluable results the princess occasionally would act with the utmost dignity or endure some insult without a word so that lady charlotte herself felt humiliated a friend reported on one occasion that the tsar of russia meant to call upon her an honour for which she said she would give both her ears though they are very ugly she dressed in delight and waited all the afternoon with lady charlotte beside her till it was seven oclock for four hours they sat opposite each other keeping up a miserable small talk and though the tsar never came the princess would not own that she was disappointed it was not wonderful perhaps that she should relapse after these fruitless efforts into wilder dissipation than ever when there was no company she would sit over the fire after dinner modelling a little figure of her husband in wax transfixing it with a pin and holding it over the flames so that it melted away was one to laugh or was it not unspeakably tragic sometimes says lady charlotte she had the feelings of one who humours a mad woman but advice and sentiment had no power to stay the course of the uneasy woman she was too sensitive to ignore the slights which people who as she observed would eat her food thought fit to put upon her and she was foolish enough to seek redress by making friends of her inferiors the description which lady charlotte gives of that incongruous piece of patchwork the villa at blackheath it is all glitter and glare and trick everything is tinsel and trumpery about it it is altogether like a bad dream represents very well the impression which her life makes upon us it is like cremorne or vauxhall by daylight when the lamps are out and the pale minarets and pagodas are exposed to the sun with all their stains and frivolities and their midnight grimace lady charlottes proprieties were constantly shocked and as she could in no way prevent the disaster she left her mistress in without offending her in order she pretended to take her children to geneva she was little more however than a correct and kindly woman with a diffuse taste for sentiment of all kinds whether in people or art or letters and when she had no point to concentrate her mind upon her observations become insipid the princess of wales vulgar and flighty as she was had the quality of making people interested in her not for her fate alone but because she had lively feelings and expressed them nakedly lady charlotte when set adrift upon the continent and exposed now to a picture now to a church now to the historical associations of versailles floats with all her sails spread upon a leaden sea i gazed once more at the undying beauties of the immortal venus i felt a spark of inspiration emanate from the divine apollo time and circumstance tore me away she came at length to geneva and settled herself in the midst of the literary and scientific republic smiling and sighing when she remembered the great stage of life upon which she had acted so lately but she was not to philosophise for long the rumour spread that the princess with a motley court was upon them and some of the english ladies hastily made up a ball in her honour with what an expression lady charlotte gazed upon the figure of her late mistress dressed en venus waltzing all night long we can imagine it is a delightful picture i was unfeignedly grieved and thought it would be my own fault if she caught me again in a hurry but lady charlotte was too goodnatured to desert any one in difficulties she had a family to support and after a few months she joined the princess at genoa as her ladyinwaiting she found that mr craven and mr gell her respectable english friends had left her and her own position was more odious than ever bergami the tall italian courier was now the favourite and the princess drove about in a carriage shaped like a seashell lined with blue velvet and drawn by piebald ponies she protested that she meant to travel on and on to visit greece and never to return to england lady charlotte had to shut both eyes and ears but her charity was at length exhausted and she finally left the princess in the last of the english courtiers to stay with her lady charlotte went to rome and the princess wandered about italy adding doubtful countesses of decayed nobility to her train and abbes who could speak fortyfour different languages both living and dead in perfection so they assure me the last sight of her was reported by an english lady living at florence who came upon a procession of carriages at some little country village drawn by the piebald horses and occupied by a rabble rout of lowlooking men and women dressed like itinerant show players of all nationalities among them was one fat woman who was said to be the princess of wales most readers will be tempted to skip the reflections which lady charlotte has to record about rome for she echoed the taste of her time and it is not ours but she corresponded still with the princess and received from her a number of those odd ungrammatical letters where all the ts are ds which still sound so lively so absurd and so unhappy all de fine english folk leave me she writes i not send them away though bye the bye some of dem not behave as civil as i could like i detest rome it is the burialplace of departed grandeur it is very well to see it once like a raree show i shall die of de blue devils as you english call it i very often we cook our own dinner what voud de english people say if dey heard dat oh fie princess of wales lady charlotte returned to london in in order to introduce an orphan niece to the world she was fortyfour and the diary though it is still as profuse as ever describes merely the respectable life of a lady living in good society with the remains of beauty and many memories of happier days major denham described the interior of africa tom moore sang the parting of the ships each to sail over the lonely ocean how very true it is to nature how thrilling to those who have witnessed the scene once she met mrs mee the miniature painter and another eccentric little artist by name blake who talked to her about his painting and seemed to her full of imagination and genius she saw sir thomas lawrence sneer as he watched them but the diary ends fitly enough with the death of queen caroline a few days after she had knocked at the door of westminster abbey in vain many people felt that there was an end to an awkward situation lady charlotte as one might expect had a final word of regret for the poor woman and in this case at least we may believe that she meant it for she had been a good friend the stranger in london every one who writes at all writes a diary of impressions when he travels abroad the scene is so new so original and so charmingly arranged as though on purpose to be looked at and written about that the fingers curve round a visionary pen and the lips form words instinctively it would be pleasant to think that this habit is not altogether vain and the eagerness with which we read foreign impressions of ourselves gives us good reason to hope it is not necessary to be profound to compare situations or to forecast the future in order to interest all that is required of you is to see truly and to describe as closely as may be the gift is almost obsolete among natives of a respectable age for the same reason that you rarely find a middleaged person who can describe the shape of a coal scuttle oxford street kensington gardens piccadilly the names of these places alone rouse so many echoes the sight of them is so confused with a multitude of other sights that a cockney who should sit down to describe them might end with an essay upon party government or a dissertation upon the immortality of the soul the impressions of m huard and herr rutari make excellent reading because they have a certain detachment we see our surface as though in some spontaneous mirror and yet the image there is coloured by a number of personal and national idiosyncrasies which make it in another sense full of suggestions for us the foundation of the picture is much the same in both cases each traveller exclaims at the size of london its uproar its multitudes its incongruities one might think to hear them that paris was a clean country town and berlin a centre of provincial culture like leeds each takes a drive through the streets and is bewildered and exhilarated by the innumerable types which pour through the narrow channels always moving always changing and giving off a perpetual uproar each marvels at the dexterity of the newsboys and at the majesty of the policemen they visit the city the tower greenwich and show themselves sensitive as only foreigners are to the imprisonments and executions which have taken place there etesvous bien sur m huard asked the guard at the tower quaucun fantome nerre ici la nuit trainant ses chaines et murmurant ses plaintes quite sure sir the good man answered and we should most of us agree with him they quote their lambs and their spectator recall what dr johnson said about charing cross and imagine how many distinguished people have walked where we walk now there is something perhaps a little simple in these reflections suggestive of a tourist with a baedeker but when we have read further we understand that it is no pose but a genuine impulse london they both agree is immensely old if addison and his friends were to come to life again nay richard the third himself they would find their haunts unchanged in keinem lande verandern sich die zustande so wenig wie in england says herr rutari and goes on to insist that it is on account of this conservatism that it has a greater charm than any other town in the world both travellers dwell with a kind of humorous tenderness upon the oddities and inconsistencies which are felt even in our streets they find a perpetual fascination in the sight of the immense town which has gone on growing for so many centuries absorbing whole worlds and finding space for them adding impartially splendid buildings and mean ones and holding the tumult together by some central heat of its own the variety of the streets never palls and owing to the capricious way in which the place has come together contrasts of the strongest kind are everywhere laid side by side like strips of different colour m huard an artist as his illustrations prove does not care to seek the causes of sights that make london unlike any other place to look at he hazards an explanation breathes a sigh and then devotes himself to the subtleties of our mysterious atmosphere we may trace a certain sprightly malice in some of his remarks the meetings at the marble arch tickled him considerably an old gentleman expounds the scriptures accompanied by une veille lady seche propre anguleuse qui ferme les yeux des quelle ouvre la bouche et la bouche des quelle ouvre les yeux and shoots severe glances at frivolous french strangers could we ever do the like in pais jen doute car malins et moqueurs nous avons a lexces le sentiment du ridicule et nous hesitons toujours a publier une conviction forte we may even suspect a smile hidden quickly when he expatiates upon the discrets petits squares silencieux qui ont garde ce je ne sais quoi dintime dhumain de personnel qui fait le charme des habitations anglaises they are charming but a little shabby and humble after the smart white streets of paris herr rutari is as sensitive to the beauty of london as m huard but he prefers the sterner side of it and cannot stop at aesthetic appreciation but must find a meaning beneath the surface the city fascinates him more than any other part because of the tremendous operations which take place there they excite him so much that he fancies a peculiar dignity in the face of the poorest clerk who earns his living at the centre of the world it fascinates him too because it brings home to him in the most conclusive way the reverse of the picture the innumerable beggars the horror of the low streets and the struggle which drives the populace up and down the pavement all day long seeking a living like m huard he is amazed by the tokens of intense poverty that meet his eye everywhere mocking the splendour of mayfair even and protests that such sights are only to be seen in london but then st doch london der inbegriff aller widerspriiche and by weighing one quality with another he comes at a likeness of the english character which is sufficiently agreeable whether we recognise it or not the english he says are a people without nerves of admirable cleanliness and muscular force all their virtues are displayed upon the turf at lords when the youth of england play the hereditary game under the eyes of their parents and may be summed up in the true english word gentleman centuries have gone to produce this excellent specimen endowing him finally with an atmosphere almost of romance and his sister with her fresh cheeks at once suggests that she is the descendant of the long line of illustrious women whose portraits hang in the ancestral home the rich past underlies all english customs and ideas and serves together with their isolated position to make them almost grotesquely independent of other people not only do they hoard all kinds of odd little habits but they have built up a singular point of view for themselves in art and literature while tolstoy ibsen and nietzsche sent waves of fresh thought across the continent the english slept undisturbed or did not raise their eyes from their own affairs a more serious charge is that a foreigner accustomed to a free discussion of all subjects upon the continent finds no frischen lebhaften streit der geister in england and yet such is their inconsistency that in spite of this reticence and the complete indifference of the state a lusty art flourishes fills an academy full of pictures every year and private people are found to line their houses with portraits in a way that is unknown on the continent as to the quality of these works herr rutari is not enthusiastic he finds in them robust thought humour and a taste for depicting children and dogs but all english art he declares is tinged with sentimentality the english temperament however is on the whole a wonderful compound of humours and oddities controlled as the city of london herself by some profound heat which now and again throws off a shakespeare or a dickens it is characteristic of the continental view that dickens is more quoted than any other english writer and is held to be the type of our national genius a week in the white house dr hale was invited lately to spend a week at the white house and during his stay he observed the president from morning till night he was further allowed to write down these observations to publish them in a small volume and to claim for his work that it is by all odds the most intimate study of mr roosevelt ever made public it is not often that distinguished men will submit to such an ordeal but dr hale is surely speaking the truth when he says that if by such means one could get an accurate and realistic picture of the president or of the dustman we might add nothing could exceed the interest of it but prudence a glance at biographies a glance at living men and women make us reflect that it is a perilous undertaking and suggest a doubt whether dr hales method is really so simple as it seems his plan to use his own words is to give a verbal cinematographic study of the president to sit with open eyes and let the president print his image a million times upon the retina chartran sargent rouland and others have tried to secure his likeness in paint but he is imprisoned on canvas the only medium that can keep pace with his moods flowing into them as lead into a mould that is forever recast is the medium of words the objection to the method is perhaps that it lays too great a strain upon the reader in the first place he receives so many shocks and must understand so much by them and in the second that words were never meant to take the place of eyes but to interpret what they see to enlarge upon these peculiarities however would be to brand oneself both dullard and pedant an unenviable reputation and to escape it let us own immediately that dr hales book leaves a very distinct impression whether you are justified in thinking that it is an impression of mr roosevelt is another matter but it should be explained at once that dr hale confines himself to the character of the man and has nothing to say of his politics get the permanent features of the scene in mind dr hale commands in the manner of one who is about to bring off a conjuring trick and accordingly we imagine a room furnished with a large writingtable some leather armchairs a globe and an art nouveau lamp there is a photograph of a bear and a framed autograph of a sonnet by j j ingalls called opportunity the impression which you are to take away from this glance is naturally that the president of the united states enjoys no greater luxury than the ordinary business man that decrees which change the face of the world are written at a commonplace table from a substantial armchair you may moralise as you choose upon the contrast and if you are happily inspired the figure of the president himself which is flashed upon the plate directly afterwards will crown your thoughts appropriately you know his features the closeclipped brachycephalous head closeclipped moustache pincenez square and terribly rigid jaw hair and moustache indeterminate in colour eyes a clear blue cheeks and neck ruddy he is in short for there must be an end of quotation a burly man who prefers comfort and solidity to the refinements of art and connects the plainness of his furniture perhaps with the republican virtues from ten till halfpast one every morning a procession passes through this room a panorama of the national life composed of men who come from all classes and represent all professions they ask questions give information lay their plaints seek advice receive instructions discuss policies or merely crack their jokes and tell their stories the president receives each says something and the man goes away content convinced or at the least in a better humour because he has seen the president and some of his illusions have been dispelled these conversations last but a minute or two nevertheless the matter is discussed thoroughly and in almost every case some phrase is added which enlivens the interview and gives the visitor something to talk about when he gets home surely the president was unusually pleased to see him or delighted to greet a descendant of jonathan edwards what was your mothers name then you must be descended from jonathan edwards he was a great man but he had no sense of humour italics capital letters all the resources of the printers art are used to give effect to the explosions of the presidents speech dr hale who cannot of course reproduce the entire conversation prints a number of different openings as mr roosevelt sees his visitor advances upon him and wrings his hand senator i am glad to see you senator this is a very great pleasure your daughters i am indeed pleased to have this visit from you how dare you introduce yourself to me a great pleasure a very great pleasure indeed but the remarkable point about these greetings is not only that they are discriminating but that with all their emphasis they are sincere contact with another human being seems to ignite some spark in the president and the shout of laughter the mitrailleuse discharge the handclasp and thump upon the back represent simply the roar of the necessary explosion when his visitor is kindled into animation and is conscious of a desire to return the blow the business of the interview is transacted at lightning speed deputations forget their addresses and speak good american old grievances dissolve pedants are ashamed no one can be confused or subtle or malicious beneath such a torrent of good humour whatever the business may be the president at once insists that he has personal knowledge of it that he has driven a train or run a fireengine or lived on a ranche and is therefore fallible and human moreover such passions have a part in the sum of civic virtue while he talks he stands or walks about the room throws himself on a sofa or perches on the corner of his table but now and then you see him write a note or sign his name and at intervals a secretary slips in quietly takes the paper and disappears it is tempting but perhaps inaccurate to imagine that the great man is thus silently manipulating a thousand strings as he talks and that the process of government is going on beneath the surface all the time however this may be there is no doubt that the interminable conversation fulfils other purposes besides the obvious one of allowing people to state their case to the president in person and to receive his answer every man has in him something that the president does not know and would like to possess his talk is often but a rapid search for a fact or a point of view he takes up a new man with a new interest like a machine grabbing a new piece of metal to shape it to the requirement in precisely so many seconds one of the results of this habit is that the president has an amazing number of facts in his brain which have come there with their own little circle of associations round them such as you get from talking to the actor rather than from reading his narrative his talk if you listen to it for half an hour lights with astonishing precision upon a great number of topics most of them as far apart from each other as sport and ethics literature and politics law and food each subject writes dr hale gets full attention when it is up there is never any hurrying away from it but there is no loitering over it such sentences of course are meant solely as a tribute to mr roosevelts excellent qualities his power vitality and industry but they come to produce an effect upon the mind of a stranger that is little less than distressing the notion which this book conveys so vividly of an alert machine efficient in all its parts from the simplest to the most private is impressive but it also strikes a foreigner with a sense of suffocation with a feeling almost as of a gigantic hand laid upon the windpipe business of course must be conducted with the speed of a machine but when the whole range of human speculation is made food for such mechanical measures there is never any hurrying away from it but there is no loitering over it we ask ourselves what state of civilisation can make such lives desirable or anything but depressing to the beholder the answer as dr hale gives it is that america is a democratic country and that the president is worshipped by his compatriots as the type of their national virtues it is indeed clear from many touches from the symbolism of plain furniture and boisterous welcome that we are to lay stress upon a particular side of the presidents character that we are to connect it with something of far greater importance than the temperament of a single man the scene which takes place daily in the presidents study when scores of unknown people shake him by the hand and are greeted as fellow men makes an american proud of his fellow countrymen impresses him with a sense of the essential worth of american civilisation and leads him to assert that no one has ever seen anywhere on earth a scene of such farreaching results few people perhaps will be inclined to deny the good sense of such simplicity in outward ornament and ceremony but the peculiar distinction of president roosevelt is that he has carried it into more serious matters than any of his predecessors he asserts that he is president by virtue of his ability but that the office by itself in no way separates him from other men his claim indeed is that the greater your ability the more power you have to sympathise with your fellows and it is the main advantage of a high position that it gives you an extraordinary opportunity for such intercourse no one judging from dr hales book can doubt that the astonishing thing about this daily pilgrimage through mr roosevelts study lies not at all in any melodramatic contrast between government and leather armchairs presidents and farmers but in the immediate sympathy which at once so to speak melts the two men together there is no need to recapitulate the different types who come to him and at once get into touch with him it is more interesting to discover what quality this is which most people possess in some degree and mr roosevelt possesses in perfection the broad explanation is perhaps that which dr hale gives life and the world in every one of innumerable phases the multitudinous deeds of men their thoughts and ways attract him with indescribable fascination it is his power of sympathy that distinguishes him from other remarkable men it is this power if we may judge from dr hale that stirs american hearts and makes them recognise in their president the true flower of democracy not only does he sympathise perpetually and vigorously but he sympathises with the common feelings of men and is as indifferent to the shades of mind and spirit as he is indifferent to degrees of rank or wealth his natural democracy carries him even further there are some qualities which because they can belong only to a few have no attraction for him the academic he says must give way to the wise and the practical he does not care for the worlds of poetry or romance he respects sentiment but himself indulges only in the sentiments that are common to most men niceties of speculation annoy him ethical refinements make little appeal to him dreams do not nest in his heart but it is unneccessary to point out that even in the most democratic of countries there must be some who dream who meditate who enjoy rare and lovely emotions nor need we insist that to disregard such men is to admit the taint of aristocracy we need but remark that even the president will not suffer everybody but the true interest of these limitations is that they serve to define the nature of his sympathy and show that it is for the simplest form of life for experiences that are common to all for humanity in general and not for individuals he is intoxicated by a crowd he might do homage to the glow in a dogs eye the fact that in each of the people who come before him there burns something of the flame that they are carrying forward the vast onset of life that he can further it increase its volume excites him and touches him to the quick his sympathy is with the normal development of this spark marriage birth the upbringing of children the steady tramp of life through dusty paths to the grave he is therefore understood and loved by the enormous numbers who are occupied with these matters and they yield to the temptation to which dr hale also falls a victim of glorifying the man who is so like themselves who by his eminence authorises their contentment after all breaks out dr hale in a rhapsody of paradox common humanity is very wonderful and very noble to represent absolutely the average man would be to be great beyond all other greatness to be the possessor of the greatest thoughts that live in the world to surpass any isolated seer or poet whatsoever this is the theme of the book and it is a familiar doctrine for it is not only convenient but it makes a curious appeal to the emotions so that one who denies it is judged to be both mistaken and morally corrupt a cynic and a person of cold imagination but however harshly you may judge the embodiment of such a theory and to speak honestly there is nothing lovable in dr hales presentment of him you cannot deny him the tribute which a moth perhaps pays to a lighted lamp it is a coarse flame fed on the unstrained oil but at the same time there is a certain rude joy in creeping close to the fire and in feeling your limbs grow warm and your brain become passive the american people however find a peculiar and a different comfort in such a sensation if we are to continue the metaphor or to change it in such a reconcilation people forced as they are to do without the luxuries of tradition must find in themselves a raw material and exalt it above the finished form people again set in the midst of vast lands beneath the shadow of forests and seas have need to worship their own force and resent any belittlement of it in president roosevelt who governs and is the peer of kings they feel at once a muscular strength which is infinitely reassuring to them and a huge indiscriminate power equally distributed over the whole of him which makes him the reconciliation of innumerable qualities the startingpoint of all their energies every virtue is possible no other way of life surpasses theirs when there is one who recognises in his own person and in the persons of others the sufficiency of their native gifts for all aims that a human being need pursue they welcome him as the accurate type of their soul flung off by nature in an impetuous mood and claim for it that it is made after the original pattern and fashioned out of the pure clay scottish women the title of mr grahams book suggest that it belongs to a class which is of doubtful reputation the public we know will pay thrice as much for an engraving from sir joshua if the subject is a woman as it will pay for a picture of equal merit if the subject is a man the pious belief seems to be that great grandmothers when they are dead crumble to a sweet dust like the dust of old rose leaves resembling no substance or fragrance that we can find among the living in order to gratify the taste the print shops hang their windows with countess spencers and nelly obriens and the book shops are prolific of their memoirs and their loveletters from which it appears that half the disreputable women of history were ladies of distinguished merit and domestic charm we are relieved to find that mr graham is not among the devout he will pay his subject the compliment of believing that it has substance enough to stand close examination and will not vanish even if he sometimes chooses to laugh at it it has been his object to present biographical portraits of women of different types who have only this in common that they are scotswomen and in some way or other have influenced the history of their country when twenty years ago the ladies of scotland raised a sum of money in order to erect a statue to a famous and typical scotswoman they could settle upon no one who came up to their ideal there were numbers of interesting women but no single great one it would of course be too rash to assign a cause for this failure for we know that nature where genius is concerned will not listen to reason but these nineteen types serve to show us at any rate some of the facts that made the women of scotland what they were and it is perhaps because it furnishes us with this comprehensive view that mr grahams book has its interest the nineteen scotswomen at the same time that they reveal themselves seem to be revealing a view of scotland from age to age and if this is partly because genius never made them independent of their circumstances it is also because they were in touch with a more permanent state of affairs than the women of england or of france to understand them we must know something of the history of their country we find the early woman the slave of her husband a stout labourer in the fields where the thickness of her legs got her the title of strongposted timber from some english traveller and if she misbehaved herself her husband could have her shut up in a cage it is not surprising that women of high rank and character should devote themselves to arduous works of a philanthropic nature such as the establishment of colleges and the building of bridges when their means permitted it for the benefits that appealed to them naturally were of a practical kind later when their husbands and brothers were fighting with their own countrymen or the stranger there is scarcely a clan without its story of some heroic lady who hid her husband outwitted his enemy or like black agnes of dunbar held his fortress for months against the english their vigour showed itself also in a peculiar power of coarse witticism the wit of a woman against men but they paid dear for their passions and were burnt caged or branded after the brutal custom of the times in the days of the covenant women as one might expect were the hottest enthusiasts lady hamilton rode against her own son with golden bullets in her pistol to exorcise his devil a servant girl would die rather than keep from the meetings and the martyrs of the solway persisted in their faith until the waves covered them but what remains of such people a rhyme or a legend unless we can show that their virtues have somehow gone to fortify the race the lives of women like the duchess of lauderdale lady grisell baillie and gays duchess of queensberry though they differ very much in the way it is applied show equally a strain of wild vigour running through them and suggest that it came to them from the blood of such parents grisell baillie displays their qualities at the best the eldest of eighteen children she proved herself the most trustworthy shrewd and resourceful of daughters able to plan and carry out some deed of great daring or to clean a house or to write one of those melancholy old ballads with which scottish ladies have so often whiled away their time she lived to a great age and who shall limit the influence of her dogged and defiant spirit persisting for more than eighty years in right dealing and passionate care for her kindred the duchess of queensberry had fewer obstacles to fight against and accordingly her high spirits spent themselves in whims and eccentricities that made her notorious in her day she insisted upon dressing like a scottish peasant used to be overcome by the humour of the situation in the royal dressingroom and led the peeresses when their gallery was closed to them against the house of lords at the same time she was a true friend to gay and any one who reads her letters to swift can judge that she had a mind it is clear however and with their past it is surely not surprising that the scotswomens genius is not of a creative or speculative kind if they wrote they wrote ballads in their own dialect to hum over their work or to sing to their children and were anxious above all things not to be suspected of writing anything perceiving as lady anne barnard the author of auld robin gray said the shyness it created in those who could write nothing it is due to this modesty perhaps that so many of the beautiful scottish ballads are without the name of their author and we may attribute some of them at least to rustic poetesses like isobel pagan the ayrshire peasant woman who was entirely illiterate deformed and a woman of the wildest morality but had a strain of rough music in her that set all the gossip of the countryside to song all that we learn of their literary habits certainly goes to show that writing was a frivolous accompaniment in their view to a life that was generally active enough in the eighteenth century edinburgh began to be famous for those little snug supper parties which were so homely and so distinguished women of course collected the guests and saw to their entertainment elderly scotswomen in particular seem to have had a genius for a kind of middleaged hospitality they are full of breeding tell innumerable stories in a pleasant accent and have at the same time a sound literary culture joined to their shrewdness such women were mrs alison cockburn lady louisa stuart and mrs grant of laggan but though they could keep a salon of a kind the drawingroom with all its limitations scarcely seems the proper place for them we like to think of them on their estates in the midst of their own people they deal out medicines and scold unthrifty housewives when they are old they become perhaps slightly eccentric and take like lady eglinton to the taming of rats but no one dares laugh at them and in the winter evenings they bethink them of those interminable memoirs for my grandchildren which make the raciest reading in the world unhappily their reserve will sometimes forbid them to publish them mr graham tempts us with his story of lady anne barnard who has left eighteen folio volumes of manuscript with instructions that they are never to be printed for mr grahams brief portraits which are so careful and have at the same time so many happy turns of humour and sympathy serve to whet our appetite and make us wish for more louise de la valliere louise de la valliere was the daughter of an ancient though scarcely noble house with honourable traditions of military service discharged from one generation to another by father and son her own father had taken part in many campaigns with distinction but his efforts brought him little wealth and he retired after the birth of his daughter to lead the life of a small country gentleman on his estate at reugny near tours it was from this little property that the family took the name of la valliere for the house stands on a gentle hill and looks over two valleys a small valley on one side and on the other the larger valley of the brenne a few walls only of the ancient house remained but within this shell the family of la valliere had employed some architect se reposant des grands travaux de chambord ou de blois to build them un charmant pavilion ornamented with all the skill of the renaissance the windows looked down the slope to flat meadows where the river circled between rows of tall poplars there were soft hills all round covered with woods and vineyards a charming country indeed in which a girl might grow up happy in the consciousness of her own beauty there were painted chimneypieces in the rooms also which with their gentle allegorical scenes a group of ladies on the grass for instance and love hid behind a tree with his bow drawn might charm her eye and her father no doubt would translate for her the motto that was cut in the stone above ad principem ut ad ignem amor indissolutus au prince comme au feu de lautel amour indissoluble unhappily the father of louise died when she was barely ten years old and she had in future no one to teach her latin or to see to it that her translations were correct her mother from the first showed herself an indifferent parent who married when her husband had been dead scarcely a year the marquis de saintremi first maitre dhotel in the household of the duke of orleans there were three young princesses for louise to play with who also were little controlled by their mother tenez vous droites levez la tete was all the advice she had to give them when they came in to see her they read romances romped about the castle of blois and wondered which of them should be queen of france when their father died the widow moved her household to paris the saintremis and louise going with her and there lodged in the palace of the luxembourg they danced and they dreamed with greater zest than ever the king indeed was married but there were princes their cousins who hunted the woods with them and mademoiselle their halfsister with her band of violins to set them all dancing they were gay and extremely young for the king himself was but twentytwo and boys and girls of sixteen and seventeen could marry and become at once people of importance the knowledge that their play was played on the verge of that supreme stage where the king acted in the face of europe lent it a tragic kind of brilliancy one or two ladies already had stepped into the full light and had disappeared again without applause the event which decided louises fate took place when she was but sixteen in the spring of in that year the kings brother married the princess henrietta daughter of charles i of england and was endowed at the same time with some of the property of the late duke of orleans the dowager duchess therefore in whose service the saintremis still continued was deprived of much of her power and the future of her dependents seemed doubtful at this crisis it appeared that louise had already attracted the notice of an influential woman madame de choisy who was anxious to be in with the court but had neither youth nor beauty of her own to recommend her with her competent eye she saw that louise would do what she needed and suggested that she should be given the post of maidofhonour in the household of madame henriette which was then being formed madame henriette was a girl of sixteen also but as years were counted at court a mature woman in the flush of her beauty indeed the transformation was surprising she had been a thin insignificant child louis himself had called her les os du cimetiere des innocents but the spring of revealed her suddenly as an exquisite young woman frail and capricious perhaps but of an esprit vif delicat enjoue louise and her family had good reason to congratulate themselves on the appointment it was of substantial value and the maidofhonour to such a mistress would be in the highest places of the court the summer of was known in after years for its splendour june in spite of some storms was more lovely even than may and the court was at fontainebleau to imagine what happened when the sun rose on a cloudless summer morning and promised brilliant hours till dusk and then a warm summer night among the trees one must conceive the untried vigour of men of twenty and of women of eighteen set free from all constraint and inspired by love and fine weather they drove out to bathe in the morning and came back in the cool of the day on horseback they wandered in the woods after dinner at first to the sound of violins which faded away as the couples drew further and further into the shadows losing themselves till the dawn had risen in all these delights madame henriette showed the gayest and most passionate it was seen too that the king enjoyed them best by her side and took pains to discover fresh ways of amusing her there were spectacles and ballets danced on horseback at night to the flare of torches after a month the first check was felt everyone was saying that they had for each other cet agrement qui precede dordinaire les grandes passions and the kings wife and mother perceived it it was clear that the intrigue could not go on unless some cover could be found for it the cover they contrived together was simple and at the moment neither could see where the fatal danger would lie madame henriette and the queen had enough maidsofhonour between them to tempt the kings taste if he professed love to one of them jealousy would be diverted and he could court his sisterinlaw in peace the plan was adopted the friends of one girl sent her to paris another was quick enough to suspect there remained the third louise de la valliere who had no friends and was simple enough to believe had she been profoundly astute and wildly ambitious she could have done no more neither the courtiers themselves nor observers of her own time ever credited her with much wit or accused her of ambition the epithets they apply to her are always soft and honourable she was douce and naive sincere and sage she was not even beautiful but the portraits and descriptions of her bring before us the image of a tall young woman supple her head curled with yellow ringlets her eyes were blue and had an expression of great sweetness an honest look moreover simple and claiming nothing charm they all repeat was her genius charm in youth that turned before her youth was over to a dignity that had something of melancholy in it one imagines that she was very silent and said nothing witty unless she stumbled into it but her voice for commonplaces was of a douceur inexprimable the king had been used to a different kind of love he had had the flattery of ambitious women who offered a splendid return for the splendours he could bestow and never lost consciousness of the bargain to find himself in possession of an entirely simple and uncalculating affection was a new experience at first it may have been even embarrassing when louise confessed drawn on by false encouragement that she loved him the king tired of the plot changed his view and found himself enamoured the true courtship began carefully under disguises but soon in a fortnight indeed the love was unconcealed madame henriette had turned elsewhere and the relationship between louis and la valliere was confessed it was the etiquette at court that when the king approached all other suitors should withdraw so that they had solitude when they wished it but it was pleasant perhaps to come home late from some ride in the woods together and hours of simple talk to find their vows confirmed by the flattery of the court who were waiting for them to act their parts as shepherd and shepherdess in one of benserades ballets louise when she looked back could claim that she had spent one happy month the simplicity that had made her a dupe suffered her to keep a strange innocence all her life as though she were conscious that the heart of her pleasure had been pure but she woke by degrees to the fact that her state was no simple one of devotion given and received but involved relationships with other people which were not happy and reflected harshly upon her passion the queen and the queen mother clinging together in their virtuous solitude had been able to ignore the kings preoccupation when he walked with louise in the garden of an afternoon followed by a troop of courtiers they kept indoors with their eyes turned from the windows but the lovers growing insolent triumphed one day over the most sensitive obstacle of all and sat down to cards together in the queen mothers private rooms louise when she became devout confounded all her sins in one vast crime needing a lifetime of penitence had she distinguished them she might have owned that it was at this season in the autumn of that she sinned with the greatest consciousness of sin and with the greatest confusion of feeling she was at the height of her beauty and courtiers who had sneered at her because she had neither rank nor wit were now obsequious still she had but little to count upon and if she exulted in her splendid moment it was largely because she knew it for a passing one which she must relish to the full though half her joy were pain her happiness could be disturbed by looking in the glass and finding her face grown thin people began to remark that she could not stand broad daylight and then noticed that she had after all peu desprit but although she understood what this meant and suffered acutely she had a moment of faith in herself and in louis she respected their love jai perdu presque tout ce qui peut plaire she told the king cependant ne vous trompez pas vous ne trouverez jamais ailleurs ce que vous trouvez en moim brave words in uttering them she seems to return once more to the innocence of the first months of all the king protested but the charms of madame de montespan were irresistible louise had always kept one resource at the back of her mind as though she distrusted her happiness when the king deserted her she would take the veil but the king found her useful to cover his fresh intrigue and at the age of twentyfive it seemed best to edify the world by remaining at court and making public her conversion she tried to saitsfy herself with scraps of philosophy and a pretence of learning but what she read served only to disillusion her and to convince her that peace was to be found in religion alone at court she owned to a friend she suffered comme une damnee it was not until that the king allowed her to enter the order of the carmelites after having inflicted upon her the most exquisite of punishments a life where the mind was bent to servile tasks and the body chafed with sackcloth was peace in comparison she lived to be a rheumatic old woman of sixtyfive whose passions save for one importunate memory were smoothed away as the expression of a marble face is smoothed by pious kisses and such was her penitence that her body when she was dead was thought by the poor to have divinity enough to bless their offerings at the time of the revolution her bones were scattered with the royal bones sentiment would like to have it that their dust was mixed a room with a view mr e m forsters title a room with a view is symbolical of course and to explain the sense which he conveys by it will introduce our comment also lucy honeychurch and her elderly cousin charlotte go to stay at a pension in florence their rooms they grumble have no view a gentleman promptly exclaims i have a view i have a view and proceeds to offer them his room and the room of his son george they are outraged but they consent and when cousin charlotte has insisted that she shall occupy the young mans apartment because he is a bachelor she discovers pinned over the washstand an enormous note of interrogation what does it mean she thought meaningless at first it gradually became menacing obnoxious portentous with evil but if we are not cousin charlotte in age or temper if moreover we have read what mr forster has written in the past we are amused rather than bewildered we are more than amused indeed for we recognise that odd sense of freedom which books give us when they seem to represent the world as we see it we are on the side of course of mr emerson and his son george who say exactly what they mean we care very much that lucy should give up trying to feel what other people feel and we long for the moment when inspired by italy and the emersons she shall burst out in all the splendour of her own beliefs to be able to make one thus a partisan is so much of an achievement the sense that one sees truth from falsehood is so inspiriting that it would be right to recommend people to read mr forsters book on these accounts alone if we are honest we must go on to say that we are not so confident by the time the book is at an end the story runs simply enough lucy is kissed by george emerson and the ladies fly to rome in rome they meet mr cecil vyse a young man who feels in his own accord what other people feel both about art and about life when lucy is back again in her ugly home in surrey she agrees to marry mr vyse but happily the emersons take the villa over the way and lucy is made to own that she can tell the true from the false before it is too late to compress the motive of the book into this compass is of course to simplify it absurdly for nothing is said of the cleverness the sheer fun and the occasional beauty of the surrounding parts we sketch the story thus however because we believe that it was meant to take this line and we are conscious of some disappointment when for one reason or another it goes a different way and the view is smaller than we expected the disappointment is not due to any change of scene but to some belittlement which seems to cramp the souls of the actors lucys conversion becomes a thing of trifling moment and the views of george and his father no longer spring from the original fountain but should we complain when we have originality and observation and a book as clever as the other books that mr forster has written already i a review in the tls october kp c of a room with a view edward arnold by e m forster i have read mr forsters book vw wrote to madge vaughan but it repeats what he has said already however it is very amusing vw letters no november reprinted cw forster pt ch penguin p ibid p chateau and country life cultivated people grumble at trains and if they are old enough prefer the days of the stage coach when you crawled over the surface of the earth and swayed in the ruts and saw the whole landscape through the steam of four fine horses you knew it face to face they argue as one should know ones friends but surely it is time that someone should sing the praises of express trains their comfort to begin with sets the mind free and their speed is the speed of lyric poetry inarticulate as yet sweeping rhythm through the brain regularly like the wash of great waves little fragments of print picked up by an effort from the book you read become gigantic enfolding the earth and disclosing the truth of the scene the towns you see then are tragic like the faces of people turned towards you in deep emotion and the fields with their cottages have profound significance you imagine the rooms astir and hear the cinders falling on the hearth and the little animals rustling and pausing in the woods french country or that space of field and wood which a window frames has great order and some peculiar distinction the towns are very compact and the woods themselves seem more definite than in england as though nature had latin blood in her veins sometimes you see exquisite old houses with a great air of poverty and breeding sometimes the woods part and there are those ornate country mansions with their peaked roofs shining like a pigeons breast with innumerable slates emotions that form round themselves break and disappear to swell again are of course only to be had in such profusion by exposing oneself to new things emphatically presented when a person sits down as we imagine that madame waddington sat down to describe her life from day to day she sees none of these outlines her impression is created by a number of scenes and some overlap the others it is not her purpose although she writes to treat the matter consciously conceiving a whole and separating what belongs to it from what does not accordingly we take away a pleasant picture from her book in which somehow the figure of a benevolent country lady is indicated also against a dim landscape she lived in a fine old chateau a long perfectly simple white stone building close to the forest of villers cotterets the windows overlooked the great plains of the oise big green fields stretching away to the skyline broken occasionally by little clumps of wood with steeples rising out of the green her life was very solitary for the railway was distant and french people in the country visit little the evenings for instance were stately but long and sombre they sat in the big drawingroom with one lamp in the middle of the room so that the corners sank into darkness and monsieur a read moliere or some of the old french memoirs aloud with discretion occasionally madame a who wore a green shade over her eyes played beethoven and handel and as the night drew on a mantle of silence seemed to thicken on the house and park the roads were all silent and a branch tapping the pane or a log shifting sounded like a canon shot echoing through the long corridor madame waddington listening for her husbands return could hear the sound of his horses hoofs for fifteen minutes before he reached the gate when she drove out in the daytime to visit some of her neighbours the impression of those lonely nights was confirmed in the middle of the afternoon you find french ladies seated reposefully at their embroidery frames in the embrasures of the windows while the gentleman of the house reads musset aloud to them cake and wine is brought and the company all sit round so polite so stiff enduring long periods of silence when nobody seemed to have anything to say lis ne sont pas de notre monde was the phrase with which wellbred ladies swept back all that could disturb the serenity of the circle something of this silence one may impute to the neighbourhood of a great forest to visit or to take the train one must drive for miles along the silent forest roads the only people one meets are of the kind that steal out in dreams they come shuffling past you stare furtively and disappear wanting you no more than the foxes do madame waddington as a mistress responsible for her tenants asked about some people whom she met heard that they were poachers and saw the hut in which they lived but a lame woman at the door prevented her from entering do they really want one to visit them she asks but if you do you must be prepared to hear a woman say of her father who sits huddled in a corner cela mange comme quatre et cela nest plus bon a rien perhaps to an imaginative mind the phrase would not be entirely repulsive there is too much truth in it but if one is going to construct an image of france from madame waddingtons book one will have undoubtedly to ignore a great deal of repetition to make shift with thin material and to see in a few sentences something more than she sees yet there is reason to be grateful when any one will write very simply both for the sake of the things that are said and because the writer reveals so much of her own character in her words letters of christina rossetti almost all the letters which mr rossetti publishes in this volume passed between christina rossetti and her brothers they have therefore certain qualities which interest only if the reader is prepared to take a peculiar interest in the rossetti family and they lack almost entirely the obvious qualities which attract us in the letters of distinguished people they are not remarkable for their wit nor do they tell us any secrets but the interest which many readers will feel is surely quite legitimate for christina rossetti was a true artist and her attitude in private life may well be the same as that which she expressed so exquisitely in her verse we get it only in a different form obscured of course by all the furniture of existence but the spirit is the same in both she weas as we are not surprised to learn a highly punctual correspondent and wrote to her brothers charming letters the letters that sisters write when they are anxious to keep pace proud of confidences and conscious at the same time of gifts that should be recognised little family jokes are used frequently and go to support the halfludicrous images of themselves which children start in the nursery and continue in private when they are grown up yesterday i made a dirt pudding in the garden wherein to plant some slips of currant the unbusinesslike manner in which the process was gone through affords every prospect of complete failure we have visited the z gardens lizards are in strong force tortoises active alligators looking up the weaselheaded armadillo as usual evaded us there is nothing profound in it but it was the same mind that conceived the fantasies of goblin market in one sense the letters contain less than one might expect of the personalities that can make private letters the most intimate form of literature that exists unless mr rossetti has taken care to omit such passages there are no disputes no reflections no discussion of her own character or of the characters of other people but it appears simply enough from what is printed that the reason why christina rossetti did not take an interest in these matters was because she had a very clear conception of her own attitude she knew that she was born with one genuine gift and that in order to be true to it she must see the world consistently in a certain perspective i am rejoiced she wrote when young to feel that my health does really unfit me for miscellaneous governessing she withdrew quite deliberately and so to speak with a smile upon her face from the business of life and felt though she would not express it an infinite difference separating herself and her brother who were poets from the crowd of people who were not she was quite secure in her belief and all the tremulous qualities of the most modest of maiden ladies are composed by it so that her figure is at once dignified and curiously distinct there is no need to say that this impression is taken much more from her opinions upon other things and people than from any judgment of her own upon her gifts in the family life we see that she played the part of the solicitous maiden sister the guardian of family traditions and the conscientious woman who is careful of her relations susceptibilities on the death of her grandmother for example she found herself without black clothes and wrote that she had still managed to put on nothing contrary to mourning a sentence typical of something scrupulous and precise in her nature which only escapes the charge of pettiness because she was never commonplace perhaps after all that is the remarkable quality in her letters for though they are slight in manner and trivial in matter she always contrives to give her subject a turn she writes a language without affectation which seems to be the pick of multitudes of words remembering her poems again it is easy to imagine that the writer was naturally downcast and morbidly devout seated in d g rossettis phrase by the grave of buried hope but her letters show that her usual attitude was detached indeed but exquisitely playful as though she had a standard by which to judge events and was not likely to exaggerate their importance if we talk of a standard we mean in christina rossettis case above all an instinctive belief that some things are better than others but when we have said that she valued most highly an aspect of life that found its only form in poetry we have said no more than that she was a poet and knew herself for such she would have added of course that she was not a great poet for did she not answer when someone urged her to write about politics or philanthropy it is impossible to go on singing out loud to ones onestringed lyre if but she was satisfied herself she was bold to claim her rights it is something of a lyric cry and such i will back against all skilled labour she wrote to gabriel to whom it must have needed courage to write of one of her poems when poets sent her their verses again she could not be made to say that they were good if they were only mediocre and considering her tender ways there is something moving in her decision the most timid of women will show herself obstinate and heroic though still visibly alarmed in the defence of her children and christina rossetti one suspects had that feeling on behalf of her art the presence of such a feeling is hinted now and again and it is impossible to mistake the constant presence of her devotion it dignifies her gentle and rather indolent figure and suggests irresistibly that to understand what was best in her one must turn to her poems if the letters have that power it is surely right that they should have been printed and we must offer our thanks to mr rossetti for many people would have thought them too slight to be preserved blackstick papers sir richard jebb spoke once of lady ritchies fairylike way of viewing life and fitly enough she invokes the good fairy blackstick to preside over the fresh collection of her papers blackstick papers they deal with certain things in which she was interested old books young people schools of practical instruction rings roses sentimental affairs c but the fairy does more than preside we are convinced as we read that she inspires too again and again we put the book down and exclaim that it is impossible to define the charm or refer it as the critic should to some recognised source it is far simpler to ascribe it to magic and to leave it to the spirits themselves to say what magic is it is true that lady ritchie makes use of many things that are not in the least supernatural she picks up an old book about haydn or a new book about george sand she stays at a place like brighton where we may all stay for ourselves if we wish it we know the kind of treatment which such themes receive generally at the hands of the essayists they are learned prosaic or sentimental but lady ritchie is none of these things if we try to discover what her method is we must imagine that she looks out of a window takes somehow the impression of a gay amusing world turns over the leaves of her book and seizes a sentence here and there remembers something that happened forty years ago and rounds it all into an essay which has the buoyancy and the shifting colours of a bubble in the sun the genuine nature of her magic is proved by the truth of much that seems almost too good to be true she snatches a figure from the past and shows as george sand a sort of sphinx in a black silk dress her black hair shone dully in the light as she sat motionless her eyes were fire it was a dark face a dark figure in the front of a theatre box nor is she invariably kind comparing modern women with their mothers she says they may be authors but they are not such authorities they may be teachers but they are no longer mistresses we must remember when we talk of fairies and magic that the best of them are not purely visionary but see something more in common things than we do and have rather a different standard to judge them by lady ritchie will surprise us again and again by her flitting mockery it is for this reason that we are so little conscious of the fact that by far the greater part of her book is devoted to the past and dead people haydn tourgenieff bewick the misses berry there is a vivid and innocent brightness to quote sir richard again in her view so that the past itself wears cheerful colours it seems sometimes that she is more at home in the earlier days when people were upright smiling and discreet than in the present the words of horace walpole lie in perfect harmony upon her page and we imagine that the great ladies of the eighteenth century had something of the manner of her prose but to praise good breeding is an impertinence it will be better to quote one passage and so to give what analysis fails to give the stately old tree falls and we miss its spreading shade and comprehending shelter to the last the birds have sung for us in the branches and the leaves hang on to the end and old and young gather round still and find rest and entertainment until the hour comes when all is over the old branches go and the ancient stem with so many names and signs carved deep in its bark and the memories of the storms and sunshines of nearly a century the journal of elizabeth lady holland two handsome volumes with large print and wide margins portraits annotations and introduction give us after a lapse of almost a century the diary which lady holland kept from the year to the year at the same time mr lloyd sanders publishes the holland house circle a thick volume with many chapters each chapter represents a different group of men and women of all ranks and callings and is distinguished generally by one important name but the chief interest of these groups lies in the fact that they were once dispersed about the great drawingrooms at holland house and that the people composing them had been picked out from the tumult of london and drawn to this one spot by the power of lady holland and her husband indeed so much time has passed that it begins to seem strange to us that the imperiouslooking lady who sits with her foot displayed in leslies picture as though subjects bowed to her throne should once have gone upstairs to her room taken out a sheet of paper and written down what she thought of the scene we are told continually how she snubbed people how she dropped her fan how she sat at the head of her table and listened to the cleverest talk in england until she was bored and cried out enough of this macaulay but it is hard to remember that she passed through many more experiences than usually fall to the share of women so that when she sat at her table she may have been thinking of different scenes and marvelling at the accidents that had brought her to this position until lord ilchester published her diaries there was only material for such a book as that by mr lloyd sanders we only knew what impression she had made on other people and had to guess what she had been feeling herself she was the daughter of a wealthy gentleman of jamaica richard vassall and he married her to sir godfrey webster of battle abbey when she was but fifteen by her own account she had run wild picked up her learning where she might and come by her views without help from anyone else it was not from lack of care on her parents part they were too fond of her to tame her and it was quite consistent with their affection that when they saw her grown a fine girl with a proud spirit they should think that she deserved to marry a baronet who was almost twentythree years her elder who owned a country seat was member of parliament and was immensely popular in the county perhaps partly on account of his liberality and extravagance must have appeared to them mainly in the light of a fine career for their daughter there could be no question of love at the time of their marriage sir godfrey lived in a small house close to the abbey the building itself was tenanted by his aunt one may gather something of young lady websters temper from the question which she used to send across to the abbey in the mornings if the old hag was dead yet the days in the little sussex village were dreary enough for elizabeth amused herself by rambling over the great house which had fallen into ruins and rattling chains like a naughty child to frighten her aunt her husband was busy with local affairs and though he had some of the simple tastes of a country gentleman was not a husband whom a clever young woman could ignore he was not merely rough but his temper was violent he gambled and he sank into fits of depression from all these circumstances lady webster conceived such a picture of life in the country that she always shuddered at the thought of it afterwards and wrote on leaving a country house that she felt as though she had escaped from some misfortune but even as a girl it was not her way to suffer when anything could be done by protesting she worried her husband with her restlessness until he consented to travel one must not deny that he had made some effort to see her point of view and had enough affection to try to satisfy her for to travel in those days of coaches and to leave his own corner of sussex must have been a genuine hardship for an important man lady webster at all events had her way and it is likely that she gave her husband fewer thanks for the sacrifice than he deserved they set off for italy in and it was then being twenty years of age that lady webster began to keep a diary an english traveller in the eighteenth century could not profit completely by the experience unless he wrote down what he had seen and reflected something was always left over at the end of the day which had to be disposed of thus and lady webster began her diary from such an impulse it is written to propitiate her own eye when she reads it later in sussex to assure her that she was doing her duty with all her faculties and that she was going about the world as a sensible young englishwoman much like other people but one imagines that she would never feel on easy terms with this version of herself and would turn to the pages more and more for a date or a fact and would soon dissociate herself entirely from her reflections her case differs a little however from the usual one from her earliest youth lady webster seems to have had a quality which saved her diary from the violent fate of diaries and spared the writer her blushes she could be as impersonal as a boy of ten and as intelligent as a politician how far she really cared to know that flax is grown by the inhabitants of kempten and that they must consume their produce themselves for there are no navigable rivers one cannot tell but she thought it worth while to observe the fact and proceeded quite naturally to moralise perhaps they are happier without facility of intercourse for commerce breeds luxury and luxury leads to a love of gain and thus simplicity of manners is destroyed which the moralist felt to be a pity what strange conversations and what gloomy silences there must have been in the postchaise the young lady was indefatigable and honestly scorned her husband because he had no enthusiasm and no theories when they got to rome the situation was even worse lady webster was beginning to be aware of the fact that she was a remarkable young woman and all the masterpieces of the world were here to prove it she set out directly upon her course of virtu tramped through galleries craned her neck back looked intently where old morrison bade her look and wrote stiff sentences of admiration in her diary when her husband came with her he either hurried her along so that she could not see the pictures or flew into such a passion that she could not distinguish them the pictures it is clear threw a disastrous light upon sir godfrey at rome too there were sympathetic married ladies who assured elizabeth that her husband was a monster and encouraged her to see herself in a tragic light she sobbed herself sick reflected that human miseries must have an end and pitied herself for thinking so but there is no doubt that she was unhappy however one may apportion the blame for one must pity any young woman of twentytwo who leans out of her window at night snuffs the air sees water gleaming and feels a strange stir in her spirit and yet must write a few days later that she is now able to laugh at her husbands menaces although they used to terrify her it is natural to dread ones own faults and to feel a peculiar dislike for the circumstances that develop them for they make you ignoble in your own eyes and the strain of bitterness which we trace in lady websters diaries points to the presence of this discomfort she knew that she was disposed to be hard and she resented treatment which drove her to it for she was a proud woman and would have liked to admire herself unreservedly in italy too she felt often what she had seldom felt in england hours of confused happiness in which the land was fair and she was young and wonderful capacities stirred within her she could not soothe such ecstasies with any of her cold maxims of solitary comfort but admitted the thought of another for her heart to open itself into directly that other had shown what he could do in relieving her she dismissed him in agitation comforting herself with the reflection that there was a want of passion in her nature which would save her from many disasters but what will be my resource if both head and heart accord in their choice her honesty drove her to ask herself that question but it is evident that it alarmed her still as much as it excited her it was in florence not a year after the words were written that she met lord holland for the first time he was a young man of twentyone just returning from his travels in spain her first impression is as direct as usual lord h is not in the least handsome she notes his pleasingness of manner and liveliness of conversation but it was the complex disorder in his left leg called an ossification of the muscles that interested her most for like other practical women she had a great curiosity about physical disease and loved the society of doctors she repeats their phrases as though she flattered herself that they meant more to her than to most people one cannot trace the friendship accurately for it was not the purpose of her diary to follow her feelings closely or indeed to record them at all except to sum them up now and then in a businesslike way as though she made a note in shorthand for future use but lord holland became one of that singular company of english people travelling in italy in the last years of the eighteenth century whom we come upon later in the first years of the nineteenth when we read the story of shelley byron and trelawny they went about together like adventurers in a strange land sharing carriages and admiring statues had their own little society in florence and rome and were allied generally by birth and wealth and the peculiarity of their taste for the fine arts sir godfrey it is no wonder grew restive and was impatient to put an end to this aimless wandering with a family of small children in a land of foreigners among picturefs and ruins which bored him acutely one entry made at rome shows us what was going on in the spring of almost the whole of our neapolitan set was there we all made an excursion to tivoli i conveyed lord holland mr marsh and beauclerk we got back late at night in the course of our evenings lord h resolved to make me admire a poet cowper my evenings were agreeable a sharp fit of gout brought on by drinking orvieto wine did not increase the good temper of my husband one of the attractive features of those early italian travels is the leisure that people had and the instinct natural in a beautiful land far from all duties which made them fill it with long hours of aimless reading lady webster says of herself that she devoured books histories philosophies serious books for the most part to increase her knowledge but lord holland made her read poetry he read popes iliad aloud besides a translation of herodotus a good deal of bayle and a great variety of english poetry her head was conquered and that in lady websters case was the only way to her heart sir godfrey left her alone in italy for months together finally in may he returned to england without her the diary is still as sensible as ever one might imagine her a cultivated british matron with all the natural supports but remembering that she had now determined to defy the law and to honour her own passion there is something more highly strung than usual in the record of her days she never repents or analyses her conduct her diary is still occupied with correggio and the medici family and the ruts in the roads she drove about italy with her own retinue spending a few days in one place a week in another and settling in florence for the winter lord hollands name occurs again and again and always as naturally as anothers but there is a freedom in her manner a kind of pride in her happiness which seems to show that she was perfectly confident of her own morality in april lord holland and lady webster travelled back to england together sir godfrey divorced his wife in july and in the same month she became lady holland something remarkable might have been expected from such a marriage for the feeling between a husband and wife who have won each other by such means will not be conventional or easy to explain one does not know for instance how far lady holland was led to live the life she did from a sense of gratitude to her husband and one suspects that lord holland was tender and considerate beyond what was natural to him because his wife had made an immense sacrifice on his behalf he saw what other people did not see that she was sometimes made to suffer one can be sure at least that the oddities were only superficial and that lord and lady holland grown old and sedate never forgot that they had once been in league together against the world or saw each other without a certain thrill oh my beloved friend exclaimed lady holland how hast thou by becoming mine endeared the everyday occurrences of life i loved you much at twentyfour i love you better at threescore was so lord holland wrote when they had been married for thirtyfour years the one truth which be it verse or prose from my hearts heart sincerely flows if that is so we must admire them both the more for it remembering what a reputation lady holland won for herself in those years and how difficult she must have been to live with she may well have taken possession of holland house with a vow to repay herself for wasted time and a determination to make the best of herself and of other people at last she was determined also to serve lord holland in his career and those unhappy years when she had roamed about the continent making her sensible observations had taught her at least habits that were useful to her now to talk the talk of men and to feel keenly the life in people round her the house at once with such a mistress came to have a character of its own but who shall say why it is that people agree to meet in one spot or what qualities go to make a salon in this case the reason why they came seems to have been largely because lady holland wished them to come the presence of someone with a purpose gives shape to shapeless gatherings of people they take on a character when they meet which serves ever after to stamp the hours so spent lady holland was young and handsome her past life had given her a decision and a fearlessness which made her go further in one interview than other women in a hundred she had read a great deal of robust english fiction histories and travels juvenal in a translation montaigne and voltaire and la rochefoucauld in the french i have no prejudices to combat with she wrote so that the freest thinker could speak his mind in her presence the reputation of this brilliant and outspoken young woman spread quickly among the politicians and they came in numbers to dine or sleep or even to watch her dress in the morning perhaps they laughed when they discussed her afterwards but she carried her main point triumphantly that they should come to see her two years after her marriage she notes today i had fifty visitorsi her diary becomes a memorandumbook of anecdotes and political news and it is very seldom that she raises her eyes for a moment to consider what it is all about but at one point she gives us a clue and observes that although she cares for her old friends best she seeks new acquaintances with avidity because mixing with a variety of people is an advantage to lord h one must live with ones kind and know them or the mind becomes narrowed to the standard of your own set as the life of canning had shown her there was so much good sense always in what lady holland said that it was difficult to protest if her actions in their excessive vigour became dangerous she took up politics for lord hollands sake with the same determination and became before long a far greater enthusiast than he was but again she was able and broadminded such was her success indeed that it can be said by a student of the time nearly a hundred years after it has all faded away holland house was a political council chamber and the value of such a centre to a party under exclusively aristocratic leadership was almost incalculable but however keen she became as a politician we must not pretend that she inspired ministers or was the secret author of policies that have changed the world her success was of a different nature for it is possible even now with her diaries before us to reconstruct something of her character and to see how in the course of years it told upon that portion of the world which came in contact with it when we think of her we do not remember witty things that she said we remember a long series of scenes in which she shows herself insolent or masterful or whimsical with the whimsicality of a spoilt great lady who confounds all the conventions as it pleases her but there is some quality in a scene like the following trivial as it is which makes you realise at once the effect of her presence in the room her way of looking at you her attitude even and her tap with her fan macaulay describes a breakfast party lady holland told us her dreams how she had dreamed that a mad dog bit her foot and how she set off to brodie and lost her way in st martins lane and could not find him she hoped she said the dream would not come true lady holland had her superstitions we trace it again in her words to moore this will be a dull book of yours this sheridan i fear or at dinner to her dependent mr allen mr allen there is not enough turtle soup for you you must take gravy soup or none we seem to feel however dimly the presence of someone who is large and emphatic who shows us fearlessly her peculiarities because she does not mind what we think of them and who has however peremptory and unsympathetic she may be an extraordinary force of character she makes certain things in the world stand up boldly all round her she calls out certain qualities in other people while she is there it is her world and all the things in the room the ornaments the scents the books that lie on the table are hers and express her it is less obvious but we expect that the whole of the strange society which met round her board owed its flavour to lady hollands freaks and passions it is less obvious because lady holland is far from eccentric in her journal and adopts more and more as time goes by the attitude of a shrewd man of business who is well used to the world and well content with it she handles numbers of men and women roughhews a portrait of them and sums up their value his taste is bad he loves society but has no selection and swallows wine for quantity not quality he is gross in everythingl he is honourable just and true these characters are done in a rough style as though she slashed her clay now this side now that but what numbers of likenesses she struck off and with what assurance indeed she had seen so much of the world and had such knowledge of families tempers and money matters that with greater concentration she might have shaped a cynical reflection in which a lifetime of observation was compressed depraved men she writes are in a corrupt state of things but yet they like the names of virtues as much as they abhor the practice la rochefoucauld is often on her lips but merely to have dealt with so many people and to have kept the mastery over them is in itself the proof of a remarkable mind hers was the force that held them together and showed them in a certain light and kept them in the places she assigned to them she took in the whole sweep of the world and imprinted it with her own broad mark for not only could she subdue all that happened ordinarily in daily life but she did not falter when the loftiest heights which might well have seemed beyond her range lay across her path she sent for wordsworth he came he is much superior to his writings and his conversation is even beyond his abilities i should almost fear he is disposed to apply his talents more towards making himself a vigorous conversationalist than to improve his style of composition he holds some opinions upon picturesque subjects with which i completely differ he seems well read in his provincial history monstrous and absurd as it is may we not find there some clue to her success when anyone is able to master all the facts she meets with so that they fall into some order in her mind she will present a formidable figure to other people who will complain that she owes her strength to her lack of perception but at the same time so smooth a shape of the world appears in her presence that they find peace in contemplating it and almost love the creator her rule was much abused in her lifetime and even now we are disposed to make little of it we need not claim that it was ever of very great importance but if we recall her at all we cannot after all these years pretend that it has not existence she still sits on her chair as leslie painted her a hard woman perhaps but undoubtedly a strong and courageous one a vanished generation in captain mahans biography it is said that nelson insisted that there was a meaning in all written words and it is surely an admirable text to hang up in a library we take the great books on trust or we are happy enough to need no spur but to deal with the smaller books requires some faith such as nelson had lest in the midst of the downpour we the essays become dismayed our eyes closed our senses numbed the earth and sky a phantom to us yet if we can but reach the meaning what a prize awaits us there are sights and voices quite audible for a moment living things behind us and all round each book peoples some vague region and instead of a sharp circle of light cast by one pair of eyes on the ground beneath us we walk attended by a whole radiance as though the sun himself flamed within our heads a great effort will put that prize within our reach and a book like a vanished generation needs this assurance for it makes it must be owned a severe strain upon our sight lady st helier contributes an introduction in which she asserts that although the writers were neither well known nor brilliant their letters deserve to be published because they give a delightfully fresh account of the everyday life of their time mrs blake who edits them claims that they are worth reading because they are written by people with a strong sense of duty who did their best the sacred ties of nature she fears are loosened in this age and the present generation may profit by the sight of the sweet and wholesome life which was possible to their parents and grandparents the book is composed save for the connecting paragraphs of the letters and diaries of the knox family from about the year to the year the chief characters are captain the hon e s p knox rn and his son thomas edmond knox a captain in the army but there are also letters from sisters and cousins fragments of diaries journals of travels abroad in the early part of the century the sweepings of a great many old drawers in short the time had come it is plain which must come to all people who are too scrupulous to burn their letters when it was necessary to decide what should be done with them were they to be tied up and put away or burnt or printed different reasons must determine but we cannot pretend that mrs blakes solution of publication seems to us in this case entirely the right one if we look for new lights upon distinguished people we are disappointed if we look for wit or style we are given something that was never meant to be read outside the schoolroom and if we dismiss all thoughts of art and ask simply for human nature in the raw it must be confessed that the knox family was in no way extraordinary but it is still possible to take our stand where after all mrs blake would have us stand and to enjoy the spectacle of harmonious family life in the nineteenth century it is always possible to dub oneself as she says a student of human nature captain e s p knox after chasing a certain number of french frigates and having the temporary command of the eurotas left the navy when peace was proclaimed in he had married miss jane hope vere a lady with a slight trim figure charming hazel eyes and an expression of great vivacity and sweetness he himself was a sturdy man with a pink and white skin apparently quite impervious to the weather who was in the habit of saying all for the best they travelled in italy a family was born to them they lived much in paris and when the only son tom was old enough he entered the army and served with his regiment in canada letters were despatched regularly a gloom was on the breakfasttable if the mail came in without his sheet but no disasters overtook him his sisters on their side have nothing but cheerful gossip to impart how they have danced and had a music lesson seen a cousin or if the worst comes to the worst buried a dog let the melancholy fate of the duke of orleans be a warning to you never to jump out of a carriage his mother writes do not run into debt but apply to your old father and confide all your little misfortunes to him writes captain knox such quotations will explain why it is unnecessary to quote at greater length with such sentences we must construct our picture but these pages make a definite impression on the mind when thus read together in the lump we can distinguish the different people from each other the mother more plaintive with daughters to marry the sisters highspirited and affectionate but shapeless as young women are shapeless they move about among cousins and aunts dim figures with distinguished names just distant enough to be oldfashioned but hardly as yet picturesque it seems very probable that such people were alive in the year it is comfortable to imagine that the world before our time was so cheerful a place much of our history has to do with the deeds of such men and women in the mass and to read their trivial family letters is like standing on the hearthrug in the firelight and listening to evening gossip captain knox and his son although they took part in the campaigns and manoeuvres of the great armies and navies are among the multitudes who have vanished there is a certain thrill in the spectacle we see so bright an image of the family glowing for a minute in a compact body they seem too simple to survive a kind of pathos is on them because they must go but to feel this is to feel also that mrs blake might have given us more of what we value and saved us much labour had she been artist as well as editor the book might have been half the size she might have brought out a distinct shape according to her conception by skilful quotation and comment but her book is another example of the strange methods of modern english biography you are presented with a great bundle of papers and bidden substantially to make a book for yourself to arrange or to criticise to make people live as they lived is considered unnecessary or perhaps disrespectful we feel that there is a spirit in letters which we must not allow to perish but we are too timid to set it free venice the first part of signor molmentis work told the history of venice from the earliest settlement to the fall of constantinople in the four volumes now issued in a translation by mr horatio brown he deals with the golden age following the fall of constantinople and with the decadence which continued throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries and was completed in the eighteenth he follows as before the history of the individual growth of the state ignoring her fortunes abroad and narrowing his gaze upon the nature of her constitution and in particular upon the customs and characteristics of the people in all ranks and upon all occasions we take up the story of venice at the moment of her fullest life the contest which had occupied the reign of doge foscari left her with an empire on the mainland and not only gave her the ascendency over other italian states but established her among the powers of europe her policy of wise egoism and selfknowledge the advantages of her position apart from the world but yet in the centre of it and the peculiar strength of her constitution set her above her competitors she had crushed genoa she was mistress of the levant trade and it seemed as though all these victories were but the prelude to her majestic career as a territorial state but that as we know was not her destiny she failed to secure her land empire and left alone in her struggle against the turk she lost her command of the east and spent her strength in vain the history of venice after the fifteenth century is the record of foreboding and decay but at the same time there is no history which so moves us both by its splendour and its tragedy and the likeness which it bears to the ruin of some great soul thanks not only to the learning of signor molmenti but to the vivid way in which he presents his facts we can make one study supplement the other we can gaze into streets and workshops and drawingrooms and with this insight into the temperament of the people we can understand more clearly their actions abroad the first impression no doubt which the reader receives from the opening chapters of the golden age is one of surprise and paradox venice was supreme but she was exhausted we pass from the discovery of the cape route to the league of cambray from the peace of passarowitz to the conquest by napoleon there is a constant demand for wealth and energy and an increasing failure to meet the demand and yet it was during this time that the private life of the city was most brilliant and luxurious and that her genius in art and learning reached its prime one part of the paradox at least can be explained centuries of prosperous trading had endowed the great families with enormous riches and when the eastern trade diminished they turned bankers or invested their money in estates upon the mainland for the moment there was no lack of private wealth and it was possible to maintain the paradox that war and loss outside and an empty exchequer were consistent with a profusion of splendour within after the league of cambray says mr brown the republic resigned herself to the role of magnificent selfpresentation the city itself was decorated and rebuilt during the sixteenth century by a whole army of artists drawn into her service from all parts of italy palaces were raised along the grand canal wood was turned to stone and bronze and such masters as sansovino and palladio wrought out their prodigious conceptions unhampered the islands where the grass still grew were laid with stone and buildings rose upon them the streets were paved and bridges crossed the canals everywhere the gondola succeeded to the horse and by the end of the sixteenth century a fleet of ten thousand floated in the waterways not black as yet but brilliant with green and purple trimmed with embroideries and with gilt upon the prow venice became as signor molmenti says like one vast dwellingplace where the inhabitants could conduct their lives in the open the piazza served for drawingroom and the great fairs and carnivals were acted in this wonderful apartment with stone for its walls and the sky for ceiling the venetian love of pageantry was stimulated in this age both by the policy of the government which sought to hide their inner weakness by display and by that spirit of life which had come to the race after the austerity of the middle ages later than to the other peoples of italy their houses looked down on spectacles without number there was a victory to celebrate or a stone to lay or some foreign king to entertain each crisis in private life birth marriage death had its formal celebration processions wound across the piazza or there came a great cluster of gondolas down the canal with the bucentaur in their midst signor molmenti gives the detail of each occasion we can but compose some picture which shall serve for many the little black figures of the old prints which cross the piazza in a narrow file are in truth all cloaked in gold and scarlet long red staves strike lines across the background the people crowd and wave like barley in the wind when the coins are flung among them one imagines a blue sky and the faintest breeze to make the reflections twist in the water it is easy to conceive the crowd but not so easy with ones cramped modern sense to conceive the surpassing beauty of details and individuals glasses were raised that were blown at murano and had strange golds and opals in them and spiked seahorses for handles the tables at which they sat were carved with monsters and chimeras goblets of gold chased by a masters hand held the sweetmeats and the women wore stiff robes of velvet damask or brocade of rich or pale colours with buttons of crystal hairpins of amber and a myriad of gems we must imagine a spirit taking form everywhere and expressing in detail and in mass the beauty of venice and the joy of life in venice the greek and latin classics came from the aldine press scholars from constantinople lived in venice and taught the wonderful dead languages private people began to store books in cupboards and on shelves of carved walnut and the state founded the great library in the magnificent building of sansovino but the genius of the time is most fully preserved in its paintings they hang in our galleries like windows into the majestic past and display both the body of the time and the purest essence of its spirit the golden age in venice it is often said needed the plastic arts to express it and signor molmenti suggests that there is a relationship between the genius of these pictures and the genius of the venetian constitution in painting the protagonist of the scene is hardly ever an individual but the crowd and in politics the individual was absorbed in the state which refused independent initiative to the individual and aimed at coordinating the action of each member of the community with the movement of the state the private houses were built to frame banquets and assemblies of people the vast rooms did not cherish an intimate family life or shelter talk between men and women most of the treatises which deal with the family abound in moral maxims we read the women led secluded lives of voluptuous calm and only emerged in their stiff brocades when they were needed as pieces in the pageant again and again the state interfered to check extravagance of dress food or pageantry but the nobles preferred in many instances to pay the heavy fines rather than curb their passion for display even the tombs of the renaissance are loaded with the symbols of life it is rare says signor molmenti to hear of suicide and if so it is mentioned with a kind of grotesque horror his remark that the profound melancholy of death finds no expression even in venetian poetry suggests why it is that the republic produced painters but no great poet when we think of our own literature at the same period we think not only of a pageant but of the sleep that rounds it the ruin however was approaching which distorts before it utterly destroys and the still virile type of the renaissance relaxed into the fatuous insolent servile physiognomy of the seicento symptoms of decline showed themselves in public and in private life there was bribery in the rank of the state officials the aristocracy wasted fortunes in gambling and refused to practise the trades of their fathers the guilds suffered from competition and their own conservatism and foreign ships deserted the port the arts both of painting and architecture showed the same corruption the stone was carved into florid clusters of ornament and the lines were waved incongruously palaces like the pesaro churches like the salute are typical of this grotesque renaissance as ruskin called it but as venice lapsed slowly from her position as a european power and from her position as the great artist of europe she took on another aspect not less marked than the rest and stamped by a peculiar beauty she became during the last part of the seventeenth century and throughout the eighteenth the playground of all that was gay mysterious and irresponsible her likeness to a great dwellingplace increased for the people were sociable as one large family with the doge as grandpapa of all the race and the fact that they had no political existence united them in their pleasures a ball that overflowed its room would dance out into the street the great majority of the nobles were discouraged from taking any interest in the government and they spent their energies in toying exquisitely with the trifles of life they studied the art of deportment and the science of the snuffbox how to blow the nose how to sneeze how to beg from a lady a pinch of her graces the charms of coffee houses were recognised and in the drawingrooms there was talk of art and love and letters between men and women with some light discussion as time went on of revolutionary principles conversation wit scandal all the intimate relationships of life flourished with their appropriate parts in perfection the manners were exquisite the dress superb and venetian art could still adorn a woman or furnish a drawingroom with inimitable taste but venice had more to show than this she was also the city of dark streets and deep waters there were houses in gloomy and faroff recesses of the city where one could buy the elixir of life or the philosophers stone the crooked waterways with their sudden angles and shadows tempted strange wanderers to haunt them and sheltered loves and crimes one might meet both casanova and cagliostro among the crowd of queer people who walked in the piazza the history of venice in the eighteenth century has the fascination of extreme distinction and at the same time of a curious unreality the sounds and sights of the outer world are to be found here but only in quaint echoes as though in passing through the waters they had suffered some sea change but once more before she fell silent venice reflected her image with the utmost decision the pictures of canaletto and guardi the comedies of goldoni remain to describe her both within and without it is no longer a turbulent spectacle but when we look into these orderly and luminous canvases we can hardly imagine a greater beauty or regret the loss of the old splendour for who shall say when it was that venice touched her greatest heights or deny that we who enjoy her today perceive a beauty unimagined by the people of her golden age the genius of boswell the letters which are here reprinted have had an adventurous history it was in the year that a gentleman making a purchase at boulogne found that his parcel was wrapped in sheets of old manuscript the sheets proved to be letters written by boswell to the rev w j temple an ancestor of the archbishop and when the rest of the series had been recovered from the paper merchant they were published in by richard bentley with an introduction from the hand of an anonymous editor mr seccombe who introduces the present edition conjectures that his predecessor was sir philip francis of the supreme consular court of the levant if as there is reason to think boswell never wrote without some thought of posterity his ghost must have gone through a long time of suspense the edition of was greeted with applause by the critics the times devoted six entire columns to a review of the book but it was sold out in under two years a fire it is thought helping to destroy it and there has been no reprint of the book until the present time there must be many then who love their boswell but have never read his letters many therefore who will thank messrs sidgwick and jackson for the handsome shape of the volume and mr seccombe for the skill and humour with which he has introduced his subject when a man has had the eyes of carlyle and macaulay fixed upon him it may well seem that there is nothing fresh to be said and yet each of these observers came to a very different conclusion carlyle although he called boswell an illassorted glaring mixture of the highest and the lowest contrived to make him glow with much of the splendour of the true heroworshipper and macaulay indulged in the famous paradox which like the twisted mirror in the fair shows us the human body with corkscrew legs and an undulating face mr seccombe is not so amusing but he is far more judicious he has no theory to parade and he has had the advantage of studying the letters he can talk thus of a tenderhearted man in spite of ludicrous immoralities he can see that boswell was a great artist as well as a freak the letters certainly tend to make the usual discrepancies less marked because they show that boswell existed independently of johnson and had many qualities besides those that we are wont to allow him to read a mans letters after reading his works has much the same effect as staying with him in his own house after meeting him in full dress at dinnerparties the letters begin in when boswell was a boy of eighteen they end a few months only before his death and though they are scattered with wide gaps over a great many years the story is continuous there is a glimpse of boswell on every page the rev w j temple met boswell in the greek class at edinburgh university he held the living of mamhead and then the living of st gluvias in cornwall and mr seccombe describes him judging from published correspondence unluckily it is not to boswell as a dissatisfied atrabilious man but there is no doubt that he provided boswell with a perfect audience he was neither illustrious like johnson not a humorous correspondent like the hon andrew erskine but he was a contemporary a man with literary ambitions and a cleric they shared their loves and their hopes of future greatness and it was under the solemn yew at mamhead that boswell made one of his vows temple who had received the earliest of boswells confidences who had reflected the image of what boswell would like to be was used ever after as the person who had a right to know what became of boswell during the first years of the correspondence he acted the part of the brilliant but irresponsible young man whose follies are a proof of his spirit he was a newmarket courser yoked to a dungcart he was a sad dupe a perfect don quixote his life was one of the most romantic that i believe either you or i really know of his scenes with his charmers were incredible in short with such a turmoil of gifts and failings buzzing through his brain he was often really at a loss to account for himself there were so many attitudes and they were all so striking should he be a don juan or the friend of johnson and paoli or the great man at adamtown and then because he finds himself writing in a library forty feet long these visions fade and he determines to live like the most privileged spirits of antiquity he imagines himself with his folios before him the head of a great family and an erudite country gentleman he was always imagin ghimself it is difficult to decide how much of genuine feelings he put into these imaginations he had affairs with half a dozen ladies before he married he went through ecstasy and anguish they failed him or they did not deserve him but he was never driven from his elegant and halfquizzical attitude like a man who is conscious that he has the eye of the audience upon him come why do i allow myself to be uneasy for a scots lass rouse me my friend i must have an englishwoman you cannot say how fine a woman i may marry perhaps a howard or some other of the noblest in the kingdom was it his vanity that made him such good company for the vanity of boswell was a rare quality it kept him alive and it gave a point to him he was not anxious merely to display all his emotions but he was anxious to make them tell he left out much that other people put in and directly that he had a pen in his hand he became a natural artist one may go further indeed and credit him with a sense that was oddly at variance with his egoism and his garrulity a sense as it seems that something of value lay hidden in other people also beneath the babble of talk i got from my lord a good deal of his life he says he will put down some particulars of himself if i will put them together and publish them in order to get from a man a good deal of his life you must be able to convince him that you see something that he wishes to have seen so that your curiosity is not impertinent boswell was not content after all with a view of a visible progress through the world it was a view of the mind in letters and conversation that he sought and sought with all the rashness of a hero he had the gift which is rare as it is beautiful of being able to contemplate with supreme delight those distinguished spirits by which god is sometimes pleased to honour humanityz perhaps that was the reason why most people found something to like in him it was a part of his wonderful sense of the romance and excitement of life his intense consciousness of himself made his progress like a pageant and every day was a fresh adventure if he dined out he noticed that there were three sorts of ice creams he noticed the handsome maid he noticed whether people liked him and he remembered what clothes he wore it is hardly credible what ground i go over and what a variety of men and manners i contemplate every day and all the time i am myself pars magna for my exuberant spirits will not let me listen enoughbuf as time went on this sjmaettherancejyasjusjmiioinghexouldxiever cease imagining and settle to what lay before him he made vows in st pauls church and under solemn yews he vowed to reform and read the classics he broke them the day after and was carried home drunk and then all the doubts which have ever disturbed thinking men came over him and he lay awake at night dreading annihilation it is characteristic that he helped himself out of his depression by remembering that worthy men like temple cared for him he used his friends to reflect his virtues it is possible too that as the years failed to fulfil his hopes he was teased by a suspicion that other people had found something that he had missed he had conceived too many possibilities to be content to realise one only and now again he was able to see as he saw everything that he had somehow failed in life o temple temple is this realising any of our towering hopes which have so often been the subject of our conversations and letters he exclaimed was there perhaps as he was wont to hint some strain of madness in him that made his will shake always before an effort why should i struggle he breaks out i certainly am constitutionally unfit for any employment was it i madness or some power allied to genius that let him see in sudden i incongruous flashes as the scene shifted round him how strange it all was to get the full impression it would be necessary to quote letters at length but when we read for example the letter upon the death of his wife with its grief for my dear dear peggy and its glory in the nineteen carriages that followed the hearse and its repentance and its genuine cry of dismay and bewilderment we feel that boswell as he sat and wrote it had something of the clown in shakespeare in him it was granted to this scatterbrained and noisy man with a head full of vanity and grossness to exclaim with the poets and the sages what a motley scene is life it would be more rash in his case than in anothers to say what he felt or how strongly he felt it and yet whether it was due to his wifes death or whether his system really proved impossible his fortunes from that i time dwindled away his hopes of preferment were disappointed he failed at the english bar and to hearten himself he drank more than ever but we should underrate the amazing vitality that clung to the shreds of him if we believed that he shuffled out of life a dejected and disreputable figure by some back door there was still a twinkle of curiosity in his eye the great lips were moist and garrulous as ever but there is a harsh strain henceforward in his chatter as though some note had cracked with too much strumming someone stole his wig a jest that was very illtimed to one in my situation but was probably irresistible then he began to finger several matrimonial schemes to plume himself that his classical quotations had not deserted him and to run after a certain miss bagnal mr temple near the end of their strange correspondence had to admonish him for boswell answers your suggestion as to my being carried off in a state of intoxication is awful how was he carried off in the end were his wits fuddled with wine and was his imagination dazed with terror and did some snatch of an old song come to his lips it is strange how one wonders with an inquisitive kind of affection what boswell felt it always seems possible with him as with living people that if one watches closely enough one will know but when we try to say what the secret is then we understand why boswell was a genius one immortality there are a certain number of people who share mr william watsons feeling about the world i have never felt at home never wholly been at ease z and are for ever musing upon their discomfort and asking themselves what it means some such discontent seems to be the natural lot of poets and even when it is vague and fruitless it is at any rate a step in the right direction the first step perhaps towards making something better thus we can imagine an audience to whom mr fielding hall the author of one immortality brings consolation and we must be careful in dealing with his words to sympathise with the feeling that prompts them the need for such a book as this indeed is not obvious unless one bears these considerations in mind it is cast in the form of a novel but it has nothing in common with the ordinary novel it is much taken up with general questions upon life and conduct but it is neither accurate nor profound and finally although one book is called the west and another the east there is little of that gentle and charming account of eastern beliefs that gave mr halls previous books their interest a number of people travelling to india meet at venice and become fellowvoyagers for the rest of the journey some are happily married and others unhappily there are nuns on board the ship a learned german professor an indian girl going home a certain mr holt and a girl called miss ormond but to supply them with names is to put the picture out of perspective a name implies substance passions and a number of relationships and mr halls figures have no more flesh than will cover a single point of view it is indeed a modern version of the old allegory the men and women are brought together solely in order that one may ask a question and another may answer it there was never a gentler prophet than mr hall but still it is as a prophet gifted with the sense of what things are not and what things should be that he comes among us he feels that the west has forgotten how to live but it is difficult to say what this means precisely or how it is to be reformed the things that he sees and hears suggest to him meditations and explanations when he sits in the piazza at venice for example and hears the band play he reflects that the nation which first learns how to bring back the music to the battle line will sweep the world he goes on to dwell upon the modern doctrine of efficiency and the mistake of thinking that human beings are machines and then his train of thought swells into a mystic rhapsody in which it is said that all music is a march a dance a requiem or between them all life is love or war and ends in death the sweetest music is the saddest the least sad is that which drives to war that is a truth of life if the company in the piazza had been in the mood for it these remarks might have led to a prolonged argument and mr hall would have deserved the thanks of the party for setting up a theory to be pulled in pieces but as it is the argument must be carried on in silence and we are hard put to it to find some term which shall express mr halls form of thought without suggesting that it pretends to be more than it is the greater part of the book is devoted to a discussion of love and the different standpoints of men and women east and west religious people and learned men are touched upon illustrated and so turned that they seem to make parts of a simple whole is not this the secret of mr halls popularity phrases like marriage is the union of man and woman into one organism or the souls of all are part of the world soul that lives for ever have an eastern charm about them as though they were uttered by some placid philosopher sitting in the road way in his rags and there is virtue surely in the position of one who takes nothing for granted and is always ready to discuss the universe more carlyle letters it is impossible to doubt that the feeling with which we regard mr and mrs carlyle has much changed in the last ten or fifteen years the gauntlet has been thrown down twice at least for by the publication of mr froudes my relations with carlyle and by the introduction which sir james crichtonbrowne affixed to the new letters and memorials we have been urged to declare ourselves upon one side or upon the other but the public which observes silently and gives the verdict is less and less inclined to read the letters with a view merely to deciding who was in the right and who was in the wrong as the material for making a judgment increases it becomes more vain to narrow the question to one such issue it taxes our powers to the utmost to understand the more we see the less we can label and both praise and blame become strangely irrelevant carlyle himself forbade the publication of these letters but mr alexander carlyle urges that as the prohibition has been disregarded already it is his duty to publish the letters in full so that every reader will have the full evidence before him and be in a position to judge for himself it is not hard to see that the editor holds strong views of his own and allows them once or twice to emphasise a phrase in a way that seems to us unnecessary but we have nothing but gratitude for his work as a whole it is true that friends and relations must always shudder when the public is admitted but if they do as mr carlyle has done and print practically in full they kill the most odious form of curiosity the lives of mr and mrs carlyle are revealed by the additon of these their most private letters on so vast a scale that to confine them to the limits of a drawingroom is no longer possible we do not deny the truth of those revelations which startled the world when the letters were first published but when we see them in relation to the rest the facts if they are still there are different as every one knows carlyle was introduced by edward irving to jane welsh at haddington in the letters which fill these volumes were written during the five years that passed between their first meeting and their marriage carlyle lent her books he asked her to write to him propounding questions such as what do you think of the lady de stael which seem to indicate safe lines for their correspondence from the first she made it clear that she would not have meaning words underlined it was his intellect that she admired and it was her intellect that she would have him admire the early letters are full of the delights of fame and genius of high aspirations of their hero byron of the noble works which they mean to write in time they are not remarkable letters as yet and this is partly we may guess because the bond was an artificial one carlyle when he wrote to a girl of twenty was not sure of himself and felt his way behind the cover of formal sentences exhorting her to diligence and virtue which shows that he did not see the facts clearly he took her genius very seriously and did his best to draw up a programme for the cultivation of it i would familiarise myself with whatever great or noble thing men have done or conceived since the commencment of civilisation that is i would study their history their philosophy their literature endeavouring all the while not merely to recollect but to apply not merely to have in my possession but to nourish myself with all these accumulated stores of the past and to strengthen my hands with them for adding to the stores of the future their genius their ambitions was the one bond which they could recognise but as they learn to know each other better the tone of the letters becomes bolder even though they were never to speak of love they find that they have much else to speak of and gradually their first vague raptures give way to a more definite relationship they discover that they are remarkable people two originals for certain it is very kind in fortune to have brought us together otherwise we might have gone on singlehanded to the end of time she is still my dear pupil who is urged to write a drama upon boadicea an essay upon friendship or to combine in a novel but the masters care was not for the mind only i continue to lament this inordinate love of fame which agitates you so i but it is not merely in an intellectual point of view that i congratulate myself upon the progress you are making as a woman it strikes me that your improvement is not less marked miss welsh as she says herself was powerfully influenced in life and character from the moment that she knew such a man and from her letters we can conceive what the nature of the influence was they are constrained anxious sometimes even fretful she had often we can imagine to define to herself the precise nature of this influence to assure herself that it was intellectual merely and that one could not allow a man who was lacking in elegance and was the son of a stonemason to tyrannise over ones finer feelings she advanced absurd little fences which were to mark the boundaries she made him realise her rank and her prospects and that his manners in the drawingroom were clumsy she talked of literature until when he came to know her better he had to warn her against too great an isolation from the everyday interests and enjoyments of life and to remind her of the warm variegated world and of the solid living concerns of our fellowcreatures which it is not wise to neglect it is as strange to think that mrs carlyle ever needed that warning as to think that her mind was once engrossed with thoughts of her own fame and writings to some extent no doubt she kept to that pose in writing to him because it was the safe one but it is also clear that she was still unripe and chill the society of haddington was not large and it was easy too easy she began to think to be both genius and beauty there in taking carlyle for her friend she was admitting a force that would be checked by no limit save a natural one and to resist it would compel her to know and to use all her powers in that lay both the joy and the danger lovers she had in plenty but none that felt her charm as carlyle felt it and yet criticised her at the same time she was discontented and unable to work at home and his letters if they increased her discontent brought her consolation oh you have no notion how great a blessing our correspondence is to me i owe you much feelings and sentiments that ennoble my character that give dignity interest and enjoyment to my life in return i can only love you and that i do from the bottom of my heart she wrote in to this he answered in words which hint at marriage without for that would have risked too much proposing it jane welsh withdrew at once he had misunderstood her she said she loved him but could love without thought of marriage all the best feelings of my life are concerned in loving you but the sentiment was calm delightful unimpassioned it was clear however as carlyle wrote but a few months later that things cannot stand as they are but the quick obvious changes which lead to the union of ordinary people were not possible for them we may analyse their feeling and trace it to the intellect or to pride or to selfishness but the further we read the less we trust to definitions in their case love demanded a knowledge as complete as was possible of themselves and of each other the change then that comes over them seems to be not so much in their feeling for each other as in their knowledge of themselves they were both people of extraordinary capacity and it seemed again and again as the process of development and revelation went on that it was not tending to marriage the change naturally was more marked in his character than in hers and the letters which began so respectfully with talk of her genius and future became more and more occupied with his own the genius which they had both claimed for there is a kind of genius in us both was beginning to work in him and not perhaps as she had expected it to work indeed if we are to understand the nature of their alliance it is necessary to follow his career for it became obvious that if she ever married him she would have to adapt herself to fit it carlyle was never blind to facts nor did he flinch from speaking them and he laid before her repeatedly and with vehement insistence what had come to seem to him the truth he was beginning to realise what was in him and what would be his fate the burden of his letters changes do you know this as it is do you dare to front it how in the name of wonder dare you think of marrying me what was it that she was to know and to dare what is my love of you or any one a wild peal through the desolate chambers of my soul forcing perhaps a bitter tear into my eyes and then giving place to silence and death you know me not no living mortal knows me seems to know me i can never make you happy leave me then and again if she thinks of happiness she must know that self is a foundation of sand fools writhe and wriggle and rebel at this their life is a little waspish battle against all mankind for refusing to take part with them and their little dole of reputation and sensation wasting more and more into a shred is annihilated at the end of a few beggarly years and they leave the earth without ever feeling that the spirit of man is a child of heaven and has thoughts and aims in which self and its interests are lost from the eye and the eagle is swallowed up in the brightness of the sun to which it soars it is true that she hesitated said that she was not in love with him and could imagine a love that swept through her like a torrent it is here too that the reader also hesitates for even without our knowledge of the future it is clear that two ways were open to her if she hesitated it was because she realised the sacrifice if however she consented it was because one loves you in proportion to the ideas and sentiments which are in oneself according as my mind enlarges and my heart improves i become capable of comprehending the goodness and greatness which are in you and my affection for you increases and then again are you believing i could easily convince you with my eyes and my kisses but inkwords are so ineloquent how shall we when inkwords are all that we have attempt to make them explain the relationship between two such people she married him and if it was a tragedy yet a study of their letters convinces us that it was a noble tragedy they are not the wittiest or the best letters that their authors wrote but they are among the most interesting because they show us as it seems why it was necessary that the story should follow the course it followed and make us respect the man and woman who kept to their parts more profoundly as we understand them better how terrible wrote jane welsh in the last letter before her marriage and yet full of bliss gentlemen errant the object of mrs cust has been to select four narratives from the old german chronicles relating the adventures of german noblemen little known to fame and by suppressing or compressing their more prolixious and teutonic divagations to render them agreeable reading she speaks modestly of her own work for not only is it a severe task to extract the pith out of crabbed and verbose writers but her notes and her long list of contemporary and modern authorities prove how much she has read round her subject before offering the results to her readers indeed were we to complain we should urge that her modesty has been excessive of my own part in this book she writes not much need be said if we had had more of her own part we should not venture the one criticism which the study of her work suggests we feel occasionally that the adventures of the four gentlemen are not of sufficient interest to be followed so carefully and that the scrupulous itinerary is sometimes so bald as to be tedious we should have chosen either that mrs cust had furnished us with some richer background of history or should have allowed herself the liberty which her learning makes a safe one of interpreting the chronicles instead of piecing them together a greater freedom might after all have suited the subject better for each of these four gentlemen had once an extraordinary vitality it did not it is true lift them much above the level of other men or bring them into contact with any of the great movements of the century but that they were obscure increases in some respects the interest of their story the hundred odd years during which they lived were momentous years for europe and it is curious to see how men could live through them in ignorance of the change and also how it affected them there is for example the lord lev of rozmital and blatna who set forth in the year on a grand expedition throughout the world his purpose being it is said partly political but also religious and merely inquisitive he went through france to england from england to spain and portugal from spain to italy and so home to bohemia the mediaeval journey is like the progress of a fly which stops to investigate every knob every tasssel every drop of water on the approach of rozmital and his company of forty knights nobles bannerets and serving men an escort was sent out to meet them if the ruler of the town were friendly they were feasted served with wine both red and white in mighty golden cans presented with jewels and horses and invited to display themselves in some great tourney at each town the process is repeated until we get the impression that the towns of that period were small but brilliant treasure houses set down in a girdle of stone walls in the midst of a savage country the marvellous rich and busy city of bruges for example housed the wares of the known world oranges and lemons from castile wines and fruits from greece spices and confections from alexandria and all the east even as though one were there furs from the black sea all italy with its brocades its silken stuffs and its armour the visitors were generally shown over the treasury where gold and silver and jewels were hoarded they were shown the parks full of wild beasts and invited perhaps to choose some precious trinket as token of their visit they saw the great ships galleons and cogs of the english fleet lying at anchor off sandwich and in london they were admitted to watch queen elizabeth woodville at her dinner and she ate for three hours and many costly meats whereof it would take too long to write and all were silent not a word was spoken this picture of the queen seated on her golden chair with her mother and sisters sitting or kneeling far below her is somehow portentous and compels us to consider the narrative we must remember was written by two scribes who rode in lord levs train for the purpose of recording his adventures they are not therefore concerned with his political mission nor is it their business to speculate what interests them mainly is the days adventure what they see what legends miracles and strange customs they hear tell of if we find the scene sometimes dull and curiously flat we must remember mrs custs claim that we are seeing the age as the writers saw it and that we have firsthand material for whatever judgment we may pass we find then that the mediaeval chronicler was a simple matteroffact man who was almost entirely occupied with the things he saw and recorded the solemn ceremonies of the age as we have seen with perfect faith whenever something appears to be out of the way a legend is invented to account for it the mind seems content to register and never to inquire the result then is a curious mixture of literal catalogue and vague credulity the genuine charm which the chronicles possess is surely the result of the contrast the passions and joys of the travellers are simple and coarse their reflections are childlike their eyes are drawn like a childs to bright colours and strange objects but on the other hand they are able to widen their horizons and flood the world with mystery until all things the romance of the faerie queen the romance of the early shakespeare plays seem possible standing on the cliff at finisterre they look out to sea and tell each other tales of the phantom islands that have sprung out there where the houses are of gold and silver and the roofs of flowers and of ships that had sailed away with vigorous young men and returned in two years time with a crew of withered grey beards in addition there is for the modern reader a charm in these narratives which presumably the chroniclers neither felt nor attempted to convey the land which they describe the land say between london and poole is empty and unfamiliar to us the adventures of a man on horseback in an age when the roads were few and dangerous have a wonderful sincerity of detail that convinces us like a story by defoe but it is more interesting perhaps when the chronicler becomes biographer and attempts to describe a hero there is the life of wilwolt von schaumburg written by eyb in the oldest biography of a german nobleman and commander of landsknechts at present known he was a page in the train of the emperor frederick the third he learnt the art of war under duke charles of burgundy finally he became a professional soldier ready to serve any master who had need of him it is not necessary to follow the story of the innumerable battles sieges jousts and courses which he carried through so triumphantly that his biographer likens him to one of the ancient knights of the round table the impression that one gets after all these years is not of a man but of a type once held admirable and once no doubt necessary the forests of germany swarmed with cutthroats the town walls were besieged with ponderous castles of wood moats separated knights from their ladies and ropes weighted with a great knob of wax were let down to them steep walls storms that drive the ship on to the enemies lands clouds dropping over the moon at the critical moment take part in the struggle of man with man they seem to get between any rational human relationship to distort it and make it picturesque eybs perfect knight then was versed in all the crafts which do battle with these obstacles and we must endow him further with a kind of simple heroic beauty both of person and of nature the death of count william of henneberg who died in a village inn on his way to italy shows us at once the beauty and the barbarity of this ideal he called for a candle and seized it even as though it were a lance and defied death in these words thou evil enemy thou hast no hld upon me and i will overcome thee with this spear he then drank deep clasped his crucifix and prayed to god those who stood round said they had never beheld a more reasonable ending by any man in all our time there is beauty in that we feel for an instant what kind of faith drove men on like people in a mist through that dreary age of bloodshed and brutality but when all is said this hero of eybs remains a mythical personage the ideal which the chronicler has in his mind implies a world so crude so barbarous and so inhuman that we must look upon it as a spectacle in which we have no part few things writes mrs cust are more astonishing than the strange blend of penury and splendour that constantly appears in the annals of fifteenthcentury knighthood she refers of course to their dress and furniture but it is also true of their point of view they have a certain greatness of soul and are incredibly callous at the same time they travel with a company of gorgeous knights and seven of them use the water in a wine jar for a bath they excel in courage and have such blunt perceptions that the spectacle of bloodshed is a treat to which men and women flock greedily in their love affairs they were either frankly animal or if the diplomatic courtship of the palsgrave frederick is to be taken as an example made them an excuse for indulging in forms and ceremonies that are unspeakably tedious to us the last of mrs custs studies an epic of debts is in some ways the most interesting of the four it is taken from the memoirs of hans von schweinichen who served six dukes of liegnitz and brought his story from the last half of the sixteenth century down to the year the ducal court of liegnitz was the home of a strange race sprung from the piasts of poland who only ruled the land in order to scrape money from it and by the time that hans entered their service had laid their house heavily in debt it was his duty to travel round with his master begging money pacifying creditors and trying to preserve still some show of princely state whenever they managed to raise a few crowns they were lavished at once upon fresh trappings or a splendid feast but there is a note in this chronicle which we have not heard before it is a note of ridicule and comedy the portentous ceremonies of an earlier age seem to be burlesqued in this one there are still the old embassies the banquetings and the sieges but three hundred and twentyfive aged rams so old that none other would buy them serve the ducal feast and the great butter war of liegnitz when the town was besieged by the imperial army harmed only the cows upon the ramparts do we trace here the rude echo of that spirit of joy which according to a famous historian characterises the great men of a great age at any rate the attitude of the world has changed even in small german courts since lord lev of bohemia set out on his travels the renaissance has come to its full splendour and these obscure lives have somehow flitted on the verge of it to combine the two stories the story of a country and the story of an individual throws a new light on each of them and it is the great charm of mrs custs book that it not only excites a thousand speculations but gives us sound matter to make them of caroline emelia stephen the death of caroline emelia stephen will grieve many who knew her only from her writing her life had for years been that of an invalid but she was wonderfully active in certain directions she wrote she saw her friends she was able occasionally to read a paper to a religious society until her final illness began some six weeks ago her books are known to a great number of readers and it is not necessary here to dwell upon their contents the service of the poor was published in quaker strongholds in the first sir antes stephen in and light arising in a few words as to her life and character may interest those who had not the happiness of knowing her personally she was born in and was the daughter of sir james stephen undersecretary for the colonies and of his wife jane catherine venn daughter of the rector of clapham she was educated after the fashion of the time by masters and governesses but the influence which affected her most no doubt was that of her father always revered by her and of her home with its strong evangelical traditions attendance upon her mother during her last long illness injured her health so seriously that she never fully recovered from that date she was often on the sofa and was never again able to lead a perfectly active life but those who have read her quaker strongholds will remember that the great change of her life took place at about this time when after feeling that she could not conscientiously join in the church of england service she found herself one nevertobeforgotten sunday morning one of a small company of silent worshippers in the preface to that book she has described something of what the change meant to her her written and spoken words her entire life in afteryears were testimony to the complete satisfaction it brought her her life was marked by little outward change she lived at malvern for some time but moved in to cambridge where she spent the last years of her life in a little cottage surrounded by a garden but the secret of her influence and of the deep impression she made even upon those who did not think as she did was that her faith inspired all that she did and said one could not be with her without feeling that after suffering and thought she had come to dwell apart among the things which are unseen and eternal and that it was her perpetual wish to make others share her peace but she was no solitary mystic she was one of the few to whom the gift of expression is given together with the need of it and in addition to a wonderful command of language she had a scrupulous wish to use it accurately thus her effect upon people is scarcely yet to be decided and must have reached many to whom her books are unknown together with her profound belief she had a robust common sense and a practical ability which seemed to show that with health and opportunity she might have ruled and organised she had all her life enjoyed many intimate friendships and the dignity and charm of her presence the quaint humour which played over her talk drew to her during her last years many to whom her relationship was almost maternal indeed many of those who mourn her today will remember her in that aspect remembering the long hours of talk in her room with the windows opening on to the garden her interest in their lives and in her own remembering too something tender and almost pathetic about her which drew their love as well as their respect the last years of her life among her flowers and with young people round her seemed to end fittingly a life which had about it the harmony of a large design the opera the opera season is upon us and for some weeks the programme from which a selection will be made has lain under discussion no one of course is satisfied but then universal satisfaction could only be obtained if we all thought alike as it is the grand opera syndicate has to consider a variety of tastes and the ambiguous state of mind which their list indicates hints at the varieties of the public taste we shall have armide and la traviata die walkure and pelleas et melisande to choose between from these hints we may arrange the public in groups something after this fashion there are numbers who prefer traviata to walkure there are some who disapprove of opera altogether but go cynically enough for the sake of what they term its bastard merits and there is a third party which opposes gluck to wagner this last is the difference of opinion most worthy of discussion because each side takes the opera seriously and finds fault with its rivals theory of the art it is an old dispute of course but its survival shows that the difference is profound and a glance at the views expressed may throw light upon other divisions in the public mind certain differences lie on the surface thus the lover of gluck will point out that his master deals with emotions that are far from ordinary experience they express themselves more fittingly in movement and colour than in speech it is true that his music is in close relation with the emotions of the actors but these emotions are not essentially dramatic and the music raises in us emotions of a general character which cannot be referred to the experiences of a particular person so nice is the correspondence between the music and the emotions which it expresses that they seem to be caused by the music itself and only to be reinforced by the men and women on the stage in short the mysterious shapes dances and exquisite melody which here come miraculously together produce a perfect whole of which the parts seem to embody a beauty which we could realise by no other means but with wagner it is very different not only does he express human emotions with far greater closeness than gluck but these emotions are of the most pronounced character they flash out in men and women as the story winds and knots itself under the stress of sharp conflict the music which follows them and expresses them excites the strongest sympathy in us and yet swept away as we are at some moments there are others when we seem to be dropped again it is that there is some cleavage between the drama and the music music it may be raises associations in the mind which are incongruous with the associations raised by another art the effort to resolve them into one clear conception is painful and the mind is constantly woken and disillusioned something like this we imagine is the meaning of the gentleman who leaves the operahouse on wagner nights protesting this is not music but then there can be no doubt that wagner is incomparably the more popular of the two and for this among other reasons his story and his characters appeal to people who would never listen to music in a concertroom they find a wagner opera much the same as a play but easier to follow because the emotions are emphasised by the music they find the men and women much like themselves only with a wonderful capacity for feeling things how many as the opera goes on see themselves in the place of tristan and iseult are delighted with the depth of their own capacities but feel little sympathy with the passages where they cannot undertake the parts strange men and women are to be found in the cheap seats on a wagner night there is something primitive in the look of them as though they did their best to live in forests upon the elemental emotions and were quick to suspect their fellows of a lack of reality as they call it they find a philosophy of life in the operas hum motives to symbolise stages in their thought and walk off their fervour on the embankment wrapped in great black cloaks there are further the scholarly wagnerians detecting motives by the flash of their electric lamps and instructing humble female relatives in the intricacies of the score and finally there is the true enthusiast who may include or reject all these reasons for admiring his master but declares that the opera as he wrote it is the last and highest development of musical art if it is true that the reason which attracts most people to the wagner operas is that they find there real men and women with passions like our own it is also true that this very quality repels others mme tetrazzini in the mad scene in lucia is an ideal to great numbers to begin with it is impossible to conceive how she does it and then her notes are flawless but above all the combination of exquisite clothing madness melody and death is irresistible it is just the world for men and women who are by nature or calling of a shrewd practical disposition in the daytime the ideas are simple but highly romantic and they are set out with the utmost luxury there is more than one opinion however about italian opera and among the audience no doubt one could find some elderly oldfashioned gentlemen recalling the days of malibran and mario when singing was an art the opera to them is merely the occasion for a number of beautiful airs without any dramatic connexion upon which the prima donna lavishes all her skill these are but a few points of view but the variety seems to show that there is at any rate no general idea as to the true nature of the opera and that those who believe it to be a serious artistic form are much in the minority the words the opera alone call up a complex vision we see the immense house with its vast curved sides its soft depths of rose colour and cream the laces hanging down in loops from the boxes and the twinkle of diamonds within we think of this of the hum and animation when the pyramid of light blazes out and all the colours move and of the strange hush and dimness when the vistas of the stage are revealed and the voices mingle with the violins undoubtedly the great dome which has risen so pompously among the cabbages and slums shelters one of the oddest of all worlds brilliant beautiful and absurd a friend of johnson a great book like a great nature may have disastrous effects upon other people it robs them of their character and substitutes its own no one for instance who has read what carlyle has to say about lamb ever rids his mind completely of the impression in spite of the fact that we judge the writer of it far more than his victim some deposit remains with us it is strange to reflect what numbers of men and women live in our minds merely because boswell took a note of their talk two or three such lines have a generating power a body grows from the seed the ordinary english reader knows baretti solely through johnson his account of italy said johnson is a very entertaining book and sir i know no man who carries his head higher in conversation than baretti there are strong powers in his mind he has not indeed many hooks but with what hooks he has he grapples very forcibly this may be as mr collisonmorley says a very good summary and yet his character is scarcely to be summarised thus his vitality is too great for that mr collisonmorley further has the advantage of knowing the italian side of the story the barettis came from piedmont and giuseppe boasted romantically of his noble birth he could not live at home where they wished to train him for a lawyer but ran away to see the world he lived at milan venice and turin by his pen turning out ceremonial verses to order his qualities however were not those that bring success he was susceptible but so importunate that a certain mrs paradise had to snub him with boiling water from her tea urn great animal vigour and a powerful mind made him insolent and overbearing in manner before his fame authorised it thus he took it upon himself as a young writer to denounce goldoni the arcadians and italian blank verse when they were in fashion later when archaeology was the rage he declared that antiquaries should be clapped into lunatic asylums seeing merely the pedantic side of the pursuit and failing from some lack of imagination to foretell its future to succeed in letters needed in that age the utmost tact then as now france supplied italy with her reading to a great extent for every province had its own dialect authors were miserably paid and their manuscripts had to be passed by two censors italy afforded no place for a man whose intellect led him to despise mere grace and scholarship and whose temper urged him to speak out he decided to try his fortune in england he was amazed by london lincolns inn he wrote home was three times the size of st marks square a great street hung with painted signs and clamorous with droves of oxen and of sheep carriages and foot passengers ran right through the city the wheels splash you with mud black as ink there are women of perfect beauty mixing with horrid cripples fielding told him that a thousand or even two thousand die every year from want and hunger but london is so large it is hardly noticed a din of whips and curses lasts all day long and at night the watchmen cry the hours hoarsely vile hounds ring bells as they collect the letters sweeps milkwomen oystersellers vociferate perpetually in spite of this london gradually ousted all other places in his affections to begin with he found that the italian language was in fashion for an italian tour was essential and the italian opera was so popular that the audience followed the words by the light of private candles he could thus keep himself by teaching one of his pupils being the famous mrs lennox by whom he was introduced to johnson the merits of the society which johnson ruled were precisely to the taste of baretti he loved to stretch his legs to talk enormously to mix with men of all callings to ramble the streets at night with a companion and the booksellers with their vast and indiscriminate greed for copy suited his powers admirably his mind we know had strong hooks and having set himself to learn english he made extraordinary progress in that strange and most irregular tongue he could speak street slang even and soon could carry on a controversy in vigorous english prose it is typical of him that he could acquire any living language with enthusiasm but the dead languages bored him he turned out dictionaries and translations and travels with the printers devil waiting at the door until a lump grew on his finger where the pen rested his struggle to live by his brains is for us full of picturesque adventures a dissertation upon the italian poets introduced him to a wealthy english gentleman who had been engaged on a translation of ariosto for twenty years for the sake of barettis advice and conversation he offered him a house and garden in his park a gold watch worth forty guineas and a wife but the friendship ended in bitterness it was said that the watch was only lent whether it was that baretti had a drop of hot southern blood in him or whether the society of scholars was in truth a rough and hasty world we certainly find matter even in a slight memoir like the present for comparisons between that age and this one cannot imagine for instance that writers then retired to their studies or worked by the clock they seem to have learnt by talk their friendships thus were important and outspoken conversation was a kind of strife and the jealousies and contradictions which attended the display gave it at least an eager excitement goldsmith found baretti insolent and overbearing baretti thought goldsmith an unpolished man and an absurd companion mrs lennox having complained that baretti paid more attention to her child than to herself he retorted you are a child in stature and a child in understanding being generally provoking where opportunity offered indeed a society of clever people whose witticisms jealousies and emotions circulate is much like a society of children reticence and ceremony seem to mark middle age the life of baretti reminds us too in a singular way of the rudeness that lay outside the coffee houses and the clubs one afternoon in october he walked from soho to the orange coffee house in the haymarket on his way back a woman sitting on a doorstep jumped up and struck him in the darkness he returned the blow whereupon three bullies set upon him and he was chased along oxenden street shouting murder with a crowd at his heels who reviled him for a frenchman one man made dashes for his pigtail and to save himself baretti drew a silverbladed fruit knife and stabbed him twice as the only means of escape for he was stout nearsighted and the road swam with puddles he burst into a shop and gave himself up to the police goldsmith we notice drove with him to the prison and offered him every shilling in his purse the man died from the blow baretti was acquitted and the fruit knife used to be shown at dessert the same kind of roughness marks the famous friendship with the thrales of which mr collisonmorley gives a very lively account he lived in the family not as a regular tutor with a salary but as a hired friend who must talk in return for board and lodging and might hope for an occasional present the goodnatured mrs thrale stood it for nearly three years and then finding him intolerable with his airs and arrogances treated him with some coldness whereupon he set down his dish of tea not half drunk went for my hat and stick that lay in the corner of the room and walked off to london without saying goodbye johnson pleaded for him forgive him dearest lady the rather because of his misbehaviour i am afraid he has learned part of me it was true no doubt that he traded upon a certain likeness to the doctor and expected the same consideration but he learnt much from him that was wholly admirable when he went back to italy in he found that the old abuses at which he had tilted as a boy were still rampant he decided to bring out a review on the model of the rambler in which he could lash the arcadians freely in the person of aristarco he delivered himself of his views upon the state of italian literature upon black verse goldoni and the antiquaries retailing at the same time some of johnsons peculiarities that the scotch are inferior and that milton is sometimes dull nevertheless his satire told and his controversies raised such an outcry that the frustra letteraria was suspended but no such criticism had as yet appeared in italy and it is today a classic among his countrymen but he could not enjoy his own country england rewarded him with a secretaryship at the royal academy and added a pension in his later years for industrious as he was and in receipt sometimes of huge profits his earnings never stuck to him a strange kind of clumsiness united to a passionate nature seemed to make a child of him what for instance could be more childish than the quarrel with johnson as to whether omai an otaheitan had beaten him at chess or not do you think i should be conquered at chess by a savage i know you were says johnson the two men who respected each other parted and never met again english people now scarcely read his books unless it be the italian dictionary but his life is worth reading because he exhibits so curious a mixture of power and weakness he is in many ways so true a type of the man who lived by his pen in the eighteenth century and mr collisonmorley fills in the old story as boswell and mrs thrale told it with new matter from italian sources his life was full and vigorous as for his works he wished that every page lay at the bottom of the sea art and life there is in everything that vernon lee writes an emotional quality which makes it particularly hard to criticise her work again in the present book we feel her enthusiasm and that somewhat vague sensation is perhaps the most definite thing that we take away from her writing on this occasion she wishes to lay stress upon three coincidences as she calls them that between development of the aesthetic faculties and the development of the altruistic instincts that between development of a sense of the higher harmonies of universal life and before everything else the coincidence between the preference for aesthetic pleasures and the nobler growth of the individual in the main few people will deny that these coincidences exist but difficulties begin when we have to define our meaning in the first place who is going to say what aesthetic beauty is here at any rate is vernon lees definition beauty is that mode of existence of visible audible or thinkable things which imposes on our contemplating energies rhythms and patterns of unity harmony and completeness and thereby gives us the foretaste and the habit of higher and more perfect forms of life if we accept this definition we may find fault with the application as vernon lee applies it for example the works of wagner are said to have less of this quality than the works of handel but setting aside applications for the moment we must agree in our definition if we are to agree in our estimate of the influence of beauty and art upon life and to define this after all is the main purpose of vernon lees work if aesthetic beauty is to affect other qualities in the human being the emotion which we get from beauty must in some way induce us for example do right she establishes the connection by conceiving that there is a power outside ourselves which is as plato has it in the symposium the essence of beauty the effect of this real beauty is to make us aware of some of the immense harmonies of which all beauty is the product of which all separate beautiful things are so to speak the single patterns happening to be in our line of vision while all around other patterns connect with them meshes and meshes of harmonies spread out outside our narrow field of momentary vision an endless web like the constellations which strung on their threads of mutual dependence cover and fill up infinitude we cannot perceive beauty through the senses without its awakening other harmonies within us which are a part of the divine harmony outside of us a man who loves beauty in painting therefore will be more alive to moral beauty also he will be a better citizen than a man without the aesthetic sense further as whatever is in harmony with the absolute harmony satisfies our innate sense of harmony more completely it also fulfils our needs more completely for attention is rendered difficult by lack of harmony and therefore a beautiful object is also more useful to us by reason of its beauty a greek pot which embodies the same visible rhythm of being as a greek temple was more useful because it was more harmonious than a modern jug turned off by a machine and following this train of reasoning it is easy to see how the degeneracy of the moderns is both proved and accounted for but these theories which bring into force a power outside ourselves are not to be disputed because one has to deal with intuitions as far as we can judge the qualities that constitute a harmony and real beauty may be different to different people and it is only when we come to apply these theories that we are upon sure ground thus it is said that a love of beauty will bring about a love of simplicity and usefulness because the beauty of people working in a field is enhanced by their being common and useful but the fact that they are common and useful may not increase their beauty at all and if this is so then we can appreciate their beauty to the full without any love of the qualities that accompany it the school which vernon lee would attack therefore is the school which has for its catchword art for arts sake and allows no connection between aesthetic beauty and beauty of other kinds the vagueness and occasional inconsistency of vernon lees arguments seem to arise from a desire to account for things logically without defining her terms sufficiently and at the same time to prove that they are all pieces in a divine system which the reason cannot appreciate it will be remembered how when one is reading plato there comes a moment after pages of question and answer when the constructive part of the dialogue is given us very often in a myth or in the words of some wise woman the device makes us realise that we are no longer arguing but that we are listening to something beyond the reach of argument now that we have gone as far as reason will take us that is the point where vernon lee begins with very little attempt to make the long ascent which leads to the view and the result is that her statements have none of the divine impersonality which stamps the myths and visions of plato but they are expressions of individual opinion the very qualities of her style get in the way of any clear sight of the matter which she discusses images and symbols unless they spring from a profound understanding illustrate not the object but the writer but if vernon lee lacks the temper of the great aesthetic critic she has many of the gifts of a firstrate disciple she has read plato and ruskin and pater with enthusiasm because she cares passionately for the subjects they deal with moreover although we may doubt her conclusions or admit that they bewilder us her exposition is full of ingenuity and has often the suggestive power of brilliant talk one may not make things more clear by talking about them but one can infect others with the same desire sterne it is the custom to draw a distinction between a man and his works and to add that although the world has a claim to read every line of his writing it must not ask questions about the author the distinction has arisen we may believe because the art of biography has fallen very low and people of good taste infer that a life will merely gratify a base curiosity or will set up a respectable figure of sawdust it is therefore a wise precaution to limit ones study of a writer to the study of his works but like other precautions it implies some loss we sacrifice an aesthetic pleasure possibly of firstrate value a life of johnson for example and we raise boundaries where there should be none a writer is a writer from his cradle in his dealings with the world in his affections in his attitude to the thousand small things that happen between dawn and sunset he shows the same point of view as that which he elaborates afterwards with a pen in his hand it is more fragmentary and incoherent but it is also more intense to this which one may call the aesthetic interest of his character there are added the various interests of circumstance where and how he was born and bred and educated which all men share but which are of greater interest as they affect a more original talent the weakness of modern biographers seems to lie not in their failure to realise that both elements are present in the life of a writer but in their determination to separate them it is easier for them to draw distinctions than to see things whole there is a common formula in which having delivered judgment upon his work they state that a few facts about his life may not be inappropriate or writing from the opposite standpoint proclaim that their concern is with the man and not with his works a distinction is made in this way which we do not find in the original and from this reason mainly arises the common complaint against a biography that it is not like we have lives that are all ceremony and work and lives that are all chatter and scandal a certain stigma is attached to the biography which deals mainly with a mans personal history and the writer who sees him most clearly in that light is driven to represent him under the cover of fiction the fascination of novel writing lies in its freedom the dull parts can be skipped and the excitements intensifed but above all the character can be placed artistically set that is in fitting surroundings and composed so as to give whatever impression you choose the traditional form is far less definite in the case of novels than in the case of biographies because one may guess the sensibilities of conventional people have much less say in the matter one of the objects of biography is to make men appear as they ought to be for they are husbands and brothers but no one takes a character in fiction quite seriously it is there indeed that the main disadvantage of novel writing lies for the aesthetic effect of truth is only to be equalled by the imagination of genius there are a thousand incidents in a secondrate novel which might have happened in a dozen different ways and the least consciousness of indecision blurs the effect but the bare statement of facts has an indisputable power if we have reason to think them true the knowledge that they are true it may be leads us to connect them with other ideas but if we know that they never happened at all and doubt that they could have happened in this way they suggest nothing distinct because they are not distinct themselves again a real life is wonderfully prolific it passes through such strange places and draws along with it a train of adventures that no novelist can better them if only he can deal with them as with his own inventions certainly no novelist could wish for finer material than the life of sterne affords him his story was like a romance and his genius was of the rarest there is a trace of the usual apology in professor crosss preface to the effect that he is not going to pass judgment on the writings but merely to give the facts of the life in his opinion such facts would be dull enough if it did not turn out as he remarks that the writings are in part autobiographical so that one may consider his life without irrelevance but professor cross has surely underrated the value of his material or the use he has made of it for the book makes excellent reading from start to finish and persuades us that we know sterne better than we did before there are certain scenes upon which were one writing a novel one would like to dwell the story of his youth is one he was dragged about england and ireland in the train of the regiment which his father served his mother was a vulgar woman daughter of a sutler and his father was a little smart man who got the wound that killed him in a quarrel over a goose the family trailed about always in staits for money from one garrison town to another sometimes they were taken in by a rich cousin for the sternes were of old descent sometimes in crossing the channel they were nearly cast away by a leak springing up on board ship little brothers and sisters were born on their wanderings and died being of a fine delicate frame not made to last long sterne after the death of his father was taken in charge by his cousin richard sterne of elvington and sent to cambridge he sat with john hallstevenson under a great walnut tree in the court of jesus college reading rabelais rochester and aphra behn homer virgil and theocritus evil books and good books so that they called the tree the tree of knowledge sterne further railed at rhetoric logic and metaphysics amused that intellect should employ itself in that way but it is at sutton eight miles from york that we should like to pause and draw the portrait of the vicar so slovenly was his dress and strange his gait that the little boys used to flock round him and walk by his side he would stop on his way to church if his pointer started a covey of partridges and leave his flock without a sermon while he shot once when his wife was out of her mind for a while and thought herself queen of bohemia sterne drove her through the stubble fields with bladders fastened to the wheels of her chaise to make a noise and then i told her this is the way they course in bohemia he farmed his own land played the violin took lessons in painting and drawing and drove into york for the races in addition he was a violent partisan in the ecclesiastical disputes and drew dr slop from the life then when he was tired of parochial life he could drive over to the great stone house with the moat of stagnant water round it where john hallstevenson lived in retreat from the world humouring his fancies if the weathercock which he saw from his bed pointed to the northeast for example mr hallstevenson would lie all day in bed if he could be induced to rise he spent his time in writing indecent rhymes and in reading with his friend among the old and obscene books in the library then in october the brotherhood of the demoniacs met at the hall in imitation of the monks of medmenham abbey but it was a rustic copy for they were noisy yorkshire squires and gentlemen who hunted by day drank deep into the night and told rude stories over their burgundy their spirit and their oddity for they were the freaks of the countryside rejoiced sterne hugely just as he loved the immense freedom of the old writers when he was back in his parsonage again he had books all round him to take the place of talk york was full of books for the sales of the county took place there sternes love of books reminds us sometimes of charles lamb he loved the vast forgotten folios where a lifetime of learning and fancy has been poured into the notes he loved burton and bouchet and bruscambille montaigne rabelais and cervantes he loved of course but one may believe that he delighted most in his wild researches into medicine midwifery and military engineering he was only brought to a stop by the difficulty of understanding in what way a cannon ball travels for the laws of the parabola were not to his mind he was fortyfive before it occurred to him that these vivid experiences among the parsons the country peasants and the wits of crazy castle had given him a view of the world which it would be possible to put into shape the first books of tristram shandy were written at fever heat quaint demons grinning and clawing at his head ideas striking him as he walked and sending him back home at a run to secure them it is in this way that the first books still impress us a wonderful conception long imprisoned in the brain and delicately formed seems to leap out surprising and intoxicating the writer himself he had found a key to the world he thought he could go on like this at the rate of two volumes a year for ever for a miracle had happened which turned all his experiences to words to write about them was to be master of all that was in him and all that was to come a slight knowledge of his life is enough to identify many of the characters with real people and to trace the humours of uncle toby and mr shandy to the oddities of crazy castle and to the studies of the writer himself but these are merely marks on the surface and the source from which they sprang lies very deep wilfully strange and whimsical of course sterne was but the spirit which inspires his humours and connects them is the spirit of the humorist the world is an absurd place and to prove it he invents absurdities which he shows to be as sensible as the views by which the world is governed the strangers nose it will be remembered just served as a frigate to launch them into a gulf of school divinity and then they all sailed before the wind whichever way the story winds it is accompanied by a jibing at great wigs grave faces and other implements of deceit and thus the innumerable darts and spurts of fancy in spite of their variety have a certain likeness shandy hall the home of cranks and eccentricities nevertheless contrives to make the whole of the outer world appear heavy and dull and brutal and teased by innumerable imps but it is probable that this effect is given quite as much by indirect means as by direct satire and parody the form of the book which seems to allow the writer to put down at once the first thought that comes into his head suggests freedom and then the thoughts themselves are so informal so small private and farfetched that the reader is amazed and delighted to think how easy it must be to write even his indecency impresses one as an odd kind of honesty in comparison other novels seem intolerably portly and platitudinous and remote from life at the same time what kind of life is it that sterne can show us it is easy to see that it has nothing in common with what in the shorthand of speech one calls real life sterne skips immense tracts of living in order to concentrate upon the little whim or the oddity which most delighted him his people are always at high pressure with their brains in a state of abnormal activity their wills and their affections can make small way against their intellects uncle toby it will be remembered picks up a bible directly he has made his offer of marriage and becomes so much engrossed by the siege of jericho that he leaves his proposal to work with her after its own way when the news of his sons death reaches mr shandy his mind at once fills with the fine sayings of the philosophers and in spouting them his private sorrow is completely forgotten nevertheless although such reversals of ordinary experience startle us they do not seem to us unnatural they do not turn to chill conceits because sterne the first of motivemongers has observed the humours of man with an exquisite subtlety his sphere is in the most exalted regions where the thought and not the act is the thing criticised where the thought moreover is almost completely severed from ordinary associations and the support of facts uncle toby with his simple questionings and avowals you puzzle me to death plays a most important part by bringing his brothers flights to earth and giving them that contrast with normal human thought in which the essence of humour lies yet there are moments especially in the later books of tristram shandy where the hobbyhorse is ridden to death and mr shandys invariable eccentricity tries our patience the truth is that we cannot live happily in such fine air for long and that we begin to become conscious of limitations moreover this astonishing vivacity has something a little chill about it the same qualities that were so exhilarating at first the malice the wit and the irresponsibility are less pleasing when they seem less spontaneous like the grin on a weary face or it may be when one has had enough of them a writer who feels his responsibility to his characters tries to give vent to portentous groans at intervals he does his best to insist that he is a showman merely that his judgments are fallible and that a great mystery lies round us all but sternes sense of humour will suffer no mystery to settle on his page he is never sublime like meredith but on the other hand he is never ridiculous like thackeray when he wished to get some relief from his fantastic brilliancy he sought it in the portrayal of exquisite instants and pangs of emotion the famous account of uncle toby and the fly go says he lifting up the sash and opening his hand as he spoke to let it escape go poor devil get thee gone why should i hurt thee this world surely is wide enough to hold both thee and me is followed by a description of the effect which such words had upon sterne himself they instantly set my whole frame into one vibration of most pleasurable sensation it is this strange contradiction as it seems between feeling pain and joy acutely and at the same time observing and admiring his own power to do so that has thrown so much discredit upon the famous sentimentality and has so much perplexed his admirers the amazing truth of these observations is the best proof that he felt them but when it becomes obvious that he has now time to think of himself our attention strays also and we ask irrelevant questions whether for instance sterne was a good man sometimes the incident of the donkey in tristram shandy is a good example his method is brilliantly successful for he touches upon the emotion and passes on to show us how it travels through his mind and what associations cling to it different ideas meet and disperse naturally as it seems and the whole scene is lit for the moment with air and colour in the sentimental journey however sterne seems anxious to suppress his natural curiosity and to have a double intention in his sentiment to convey a feeling to the reader but with the object of winning admiration for his own simple virtues it is when his unmixed sentiment falls very flat that we begin to ask ourselves whether we like the writer and to call him hypocrite the pauvre honteux to whom sterne had given alms could say nothing he pulld out a little handkerchief and wiped his face as he turned away and i thought he thanked me more than them alliz the last words with their affectation of simplicity are like eyes turned unctuously to heaven there is abundant evidence in the story of his life to show how strange and complicated was the state of mind that produced such works of art sterne was a man of many passions driven according as the fly stings but the most serious was said to have been inspired by mrs draper the eliza of the letters nevertheless sentiments that had done duty for his wife in were copied out with a change of name and made to serve again for eliza in the year and again if he had turned a phrase happily in writing to eliza lydia his daughter was given the benefit of it shall we infer from this that sterne cared nothing for wife or mistress or daughter or shall we believe that he was before everything else and with all the failing of his kind a great artist if he had been among the greatest no doubt these little economies would not have been necessary but with his exquisite and penetrating but not very exuberant genius it was essential to make shifts and to eke out as best he might accordingly we have as professor cross demonstrates the strange spectacle of a man who uses his emotions twice over for different purposes the journal to eliza in which the most secret passions of his heart are laid bare is but the notebook for passages in the sentimental journey which all the world may read sterne himself no doubt scarcely knew at what point his own pain was dissolved in the joy of an artist we at this distance of time might speculate indefinitely indeed however we may test it there is no life which it is harder to judge its eccentricities are often genuine and its impulses are often premeditated in the same way the final impression is twofold in its nature for we must combine a life of extraordinary flightiness and oddity with the infinite painstaking and selfconsciousness of an artist this thin excitable man who was devoured by consumption who said of himself that he generally acted on the first impulse and was a bundle of sensations scarcely checked by reason not only kept a record of all that he felt but could sit close at his table arranging and rearranging adding and altering until every scene was clear every tone was felt and each word was fit and in its place how do the slight touches of the chisel he exclaimed in tristram shandy the pencil the pen the fiddle stick et cetera give the true swell which gives the true pleasure o my fellow countrymen be nice be cautious of your language and never o never let it be forgotten upon what small particles your eloquence and your fame depend his fame depends partly upon that inimitable style but rests most safely upon the extraordinary zest with which he lived and upon the joy with which his mind worked ceaselessly upon the world impressions at bayreuth the commonplace remark that music is in its infancy is best borne out by the ambiguous state of musical criticism it has few traditions behind it and the art itself is so much alive that it fairly suffocates those who try to deal with it a critic of writing is hardly to be taken by surprise for he can compare almost every literary form with some earlier form and can measure the achievement by some familiar standard but who in music has tried to do what strauss is doing or debussy before we have made up our minds as to the nature of the operatic form we have to value very different and very emphatic examples of it this lack of tradition and of current standards is of course the freest and happiest state that a critic can wish for it offers some one the chance of doing now for music what aristotle did years ago for poetry the fact however that so little has yet been done to lay bare the principles of the art accounts for the indecision which marks our attempts to judge new music as for the old we take it for granted or concentrate our minds upon the prima donnas cold it is criticism of a single hour in a particular day and tomorrow the mark has faded there is only one way open thus for a writer who is not disposed to go to the root of the matter and is yet dissatisfied with the old evasions he may try to give his impressions as an amateur the seats in the great bare house in bayreuth are packed with them they have a secret belief that they understand as well as other people although they seldom venture an opinion and at any rate there is no doubt that they love music if they hesitate to criticise it is perhaps that they have not sufficient technical knowledge to fasten upon details a criticism of the whole resolves itself into vague formulas comparisons and adjectives nevertheless no one can doubt that the audience at bayreuth pilgrims many of them from distant lands attend with all their power as the lights sink they rustle into their seats and scarcely stir till the last wave of sound has ceased when a stick falls there is a nervous shudder like a ripple in water through the entire house during the intervals between the acts when they come out into the sun they seem oppressed with a desire to disburden themselves somehow of the impression which they have received parsifal in particular lays such a weight upon the mind that it is not until one has heard it many times over that one can begin as it were to move it to and fro the unfamiliarity of the ideas hinders one at the outset from bringing the different parts together one feels vaguely for a crisis that never comes for accustomed as one is to find the explanation of a drama in the love of man and woman or in battle one is bewildered by a music that continues with the utmost calm and intensity independently of them further the change from the temple of the grail to the magic garden with its swarms of flowermaidens and its hot red blossoms is too violent a break to be bridged conveniently nevertheless although they are great these difficulties scarcely do more than disturb the surface of a very deep and perhaps indescribable impression puzzled we may be but it is primarily because the music has reached a place not yet visited by sound an anthem sung with perfect skill in some great church will suggest a part of the scene in the vast hall with its green distances and yet a part only ecclesiastical music is too rigidly serene and too final in its spirit to penetrate as the music of parsifal penetrates somehow wagner has conveyed the desire of the knights for the grail in such a way that the intense emotion of human beings is combined with the unearthly nature of the things they seek it tears us as we hear it as though its wings were sharply edged again feelings of this kind that are equally diffused and felt for one object in common create an impression of largeness and when the music is played as it was played on the night of the nth of an overwhelming unity the grail seems to burn through all superincumbences the music is intimate in a sense that none other is one is fired with emotion and yet possessed with tranquillity at the same time for the words are continued by the music so that we hardly notice the transition it may be that these exalted emotions which belong to the essence of our being and are rarely expressed are those that are best translated by music so that a satisfaction or whatever one may call that sense of answer which the finest art supplies to its own question is constantly conveyed here like shakespeare wagner seems to have attained in the end to such a mastery of technique that he could float and soar in regions where in the beginning he could scarcely breathe the stubborn matter of his art dissolves in his fingers and he shapes it as he chooses when the opera is over it is surely the completeness of the work that remains with us the earlier operas have always their awkward moments when the illusion breaks but parsifal seems poured out in a smooth stream at white heat its shape is solid and entire how much of the singular atmosphere which surrounds the opera in ones mind springs from other sources than the music itself it would be hard to say it is the only work which has no incongruous associations it has been possible during these last performances to step out of the opera house and find oneself in the midst of a warm summer evening from the hill above the theatre you look over a wide land smooth and without hedges it is not beautiful but it is very large and tranquil one may sit among rows of turnips and watch a gigantic old woman with a blue cotton bonnet on her head and a figure like one of diirers swinging her hoe the sun draws out strong scents from the hay and the pine trees and if one thinks at all it is to combine the simple landscape with the landscape of the stage when the music is silent the mind insensibly slackens and expands among happy surroundings heat and the yellow light and the intermittent but not unmusical noises of insects and leaves smooth out the folds in the next interval between seven and eight there is another act out here also it is now dusky and perceptibly fresher the light is thinner and the roads are no longer crossed by regular bars of shade the figures in light dresses moving between the trees of the avenue with depths of blue air behind them have a curiously decorative effect finally when the opera is over it is quite late and halfway down the hill one looks back upon a dark torrent of carriages descending their lamps wavering one above another like irregular torches these strange intervals in the open air as though a curtain were regularly drawn and shut again have no disturbing effect upon parsifal at least a bat from the woods circled kundrys head in the meadow and little white moths dance incessantly over the footlights it was curious although scarcely fair to test lohengrin two days after one had heard parsifal the difference which a chorus alive in all its parts so that eyes and arms are moving when the voice is silent can make to a work in which the chorus means so much is surprising certainly and yet recognising the admirable performance other reflections were suggested by it the same surroundings that were so congenial to parsifal turn much of lohengrin to tinsel and sham armour one thinks of gorgeous skirts and the mantles of knights trailed along the dusty paths and pricked by the stubble an opera house which shelters such a troop should be hemmed in by streets with great shop windows their splendour somehow dwindles away and falls flat in the empty country but although this was one of the impressions that lohengrin gave rise to can it be held to be any reflection upon the music no one perhaps save a writer properly versed in the science can decide which impressions are relevant and which impertinent and it is here that the amateur is apt to incur the contempt of the professional we know the critic who in painting prefers the art of fra angelico because that painter worked upon his knees others choose books because they teach one to rise early and one has only to read the descriptive notes in a concert programme to be led hopelessly astray apart from the difficulty of changing a musical impression into a literary one and the tendency to appeal to the literary sense because of the associations of words there is the further difficulty in the case of music that its scope is much less clearly defined than the scope of the other arts the more beautiful a phrase of music is the richer its burden of suggestion and if we understand the form but slightly we are little restrained in our interpretation we are led on to connect the beautiful sound with some experience of our own or to make it symbolise some conception of a general nature perhaps music owes something of its astonishing power over us to this lack of definite articulation its statements have all the majesty of a generalisation and yet contain our private emotions something of the same effect is given by shakespeare when he makes an old nurse the type of all the old nurses in the world while she keeps her identity as a particular old woman the comparative weakness of lohengrin urges one to such speculations for there are many passages which fit loosely to the singers mood and yet carry ones mind out with a beauty of their own in the meantime we are miserably aware how little words can do to render music when the moment of suspense is over and the bows actually move across the strings our definitions are relinguished and words disappear in our minds enormous is the relief and yet when the spell is over how great is the joy with which we turn to our old tools again these definitions indeed which would limit the bounds of an art and regulate our emotions are arbitrary enough and here at bayreuth where the music fades into the open air and we wander with parsifal in our heads through empty streets at night where the gardens of the hermitage glow with flowers like those other magic blossoms and sound melts into colour and colour calls out for words where in short we are lifted out of the ordinary world and allowed merely to breathe and see it is here that we realise how thin are the walls between one emotion and another and how fused our impressions are with elements which we may not attempt to separate thus in the final impression of bayreuth this year beauty is still triumphant although the actual performances if we except gotterdarnmerung which remains to be heard have been below the level of many that have been given in london details which have contributed to this disappointment that the orchestra was weak that there were few great singers and that the prompter whispered incessantly might be furnished but to refrain seems better since they must cross the channel oliver wendell holmes a hundred years ago one might talk more glibly of american literature than it is safe to do at present the ships that pass each other on the atlantic do more than lift a handful of americans and englishmen from one shore to another they have dulled our national selfconsciousness save for the voice and certain small differences of manner which give them a flavour of their own americans sink into us over here like raindrops into the sea on their side they have lost much of that nervous desire to assert their own independence and maturity in opposition to a mother country which was always reminding them of their tender age such questions as lowell conceived a country of parvenus with a horrible consciousness of shoddy running through politics manners art literature nay religion itself and answered as we may guess no longer fret them the old adjectives which hawthorne rapped out the boorishness the solidity the selfsufficiency the contemptuous jealousy the halfsagacity etc etc that characterise this strange people are left for their daily press in moments of panic for international criticism as mr henry james has proved has become a very delicate and serious matter the truth is that time and the steamboats have rubbed out these crudities and if we wish to understand american art or politics or literature we must look as closely as we look when blood and speech are strange to us the men who were most outspoken against us brought about this reasonable relationship partly because we read their books as our own and partly because literature is able to suggest the surroundings in which it is produced we are now able to think of boston or cambridge as places with a life of their own as distinct and as different from ours as the london of pope is different from the london of edward vii the man who contributed to this intimacy which is founded upon an understanding that we differ in many ways as much as any of the rest was undoubtedly oliver wendell holmes although he did it by means that were very different from theirs he was in some respects the most complete american of them all he was born in of the best blood in the country for his father the rev abiel holmes came from an old puritan stock which might be traced to a lawyer of grays inn in the sixteenth century and his mother sarah wendell had distinguished blood from many sources dutch and norman and good american his father was stern and handsome and taught the oldfashioned calvinism with all its horrors his mother was a little sprightly woman inquisitive and emotional people who knew them said that the son inherited more from her than from his father it was one of the charming characteristics of the mature man that he was always looking back to his childhood and steeping it in such shade and quaintness as a gambrelroofed house built in will provide like hawthorne he had a pathetic desire to mix his childish memories with something old mysterious and beautiful in itself there were dents in the floor where the soldiers had dropped their muskets during the revolution the family portraits had been slashed by british rapiers and there was a chair where lord percy had sat to have his hair dressed from the vague memories that hang about his early years and inspire some of the pleasantest pages in his books one may choose two for their importance i might have been a minister myself for aught i know ifhad not looked and talked so like an undertaker it was not until much later that he could analyse what had happened to him as a child when he could read he was taught that we were a set of little fallen wretches exposed to the wrath of god by the fact of that existence which we could not help he was roused in revolt against what he called the inherited servitude of my ancestors and not only decided against the ministry as a calling but never ceased to preach the beliefs which his early revolt had taught him these beliefs were started in him or at any rate his old views were shaken for ever by a peep through a telescope on the common at the transit of venus he looked and the thought came to him like a shock that the earth too was no bigger than a marble he went on to think how this planet is equipped and provisioned for a long voyage in space the shock seems to have shown him both that we are part of a great system and also that our world will last for a period transcending all our ordinary measures of time if it is true that we are to continue indefinitely then it is possible he found to consider that this colony of the universe is an educational institution and this is the only theory which can justify the way of god to man we may disbelieve in the garden of eden and in the fall of man and we may believe that this socalled evil to which i cannot close my eyes is a passing condition from which we shall emerge he had found a basis for that optimism which inspired his teaching and if the reasons which he gave seem insufficient his conclusions and the way they came to him looking through a telescope for ten cents at the transit of venus bear out much that we think when we know him better the practical result of the conflict was that he became a doctor instead of a clergyman spent two years in paris studying his profesion visited england and italy on his way and returned to practise in boston living there and at cambridge with the exception of his hundred days in europe for the rest of his life the most diligent of biographers and mr morse was among them can find little to add to such a record nor did dr holmes come to the rescue his letters are not intimate like other people who write much about themselves in public he has little to say in private as a doctor he never won a large practice for he not only collected a volume of poetry from time to time but smiled when the door was opened and made jokes upon the staircase when someone asked him what part of anatomy he liked best he answered the bones they are cleanest the answer shows us the plain little dapper man who could never bear the sights of a sickroom who laughed to relieve the tension who would run away when a rabbit was to be chloroformed who was clean and scrupulous in all respects and inclined as a young man to satirise the world with a somewhat acrid humour two friends have put together a picture of him a small compact little man buzzing about like a bee or fluttering like a humming bird exceedingly difficult to catch unless he be really wanted for some kind act and then you are sure of him the other adds that he has a powerful jaw and a thick strong underlip that gives decision to his look with a dash of pertness in conversation he is animated and cordial sharp too taking the words out of ones mouth at this time before the publication of the autocrat he was famous for his talk and for his verses the verses were for the most part inspired by dinners and occasions they light up for us the circle of american men of letters who met and talked at parkers hotel as men had talked at wills coffee house they are addressed to people who know each other well his reputation therefore independently of his medical works was very intense but very local he was almost fifty when the first of the autocrat papers came from my mind almost with an explosion the professor and the poet followed then there were the two novels he became in short a man of letters from whom the public expects a regular statement of opinion even at this distance it is easy to imagine the rush with which the autocrat came into the world every breakfasttable in boston knew the writer by repute knew of his birth and traditions and read his views in print with a kind of personal pride as though he were the mouthpiece of a family those associations are no longer ours but as the manner of beauty clings when beauty is gone so we can still relish the gusto with which dr holmes addressed himself to his fellowcitizens this is true and yet is it possible that we should not dwell upon such considerations if we were altogether beneath the autocrats spell there is we must own it a little temptation to try to account for our ancestors tastes and so to avoid formulating our own the chief interest however of these centenary celebrations is that they provide an opportunity for one generation to speak its mind of another with a candour and perhaps with an insight which contemporaries may hardly possess the trial is sharp for the books that live to such an age will live to a much greater age and raise the standard of merit very high let us own at once that dr holmess works can hardly be said to survive in the sense that they still play any part in our lives nor is he among the writers who live on without any message to deliver because of the sheer delight that we take in their art the fact that there is someone mr townsend to wit who will write a centenary biography for a public that reads the autocrat cannot be set down to either of these causes and yet if we seek it on a lower plane we shall surely find reason enough there is to begin with the reason that our own experience affords us when we take it up at a tender age for it is one of the first books that one reads for oneselfit tastes like champagne after breakfastcups of weak tea the miraculous ease with which the talk flows on the richness of simile and anecdote the humour and the pathos the astonishing maturity of the style and above all some quality less easy to define as though fruits just beyond our reach were being dropped plump into our hands and proving deliriously firm and bright these sensations make it impossible to think of the autocrat save as an elderly relative who has pressed halfsovereigns into ones palm and at the same time flattered ones selfesteem later if some of the charm is gone one is able to appraise these virtues more soberly they have curiously enough far more of the useful than of the ornamental in their composition we are more impressed that is by the honesty and the common sense of the autocrats remarks and by the fact that they are the fruit of wide observation than by the devices with which they are decked out the pages of the book abound with passages like the following two men are walking by the polyphloesboean ocean one of them having a small tin cup with which he can scoop up a gill of seawater when he will and the other nothing but his hands which will hardly hold water at all and you call the tin cup a miraculous possession it is the ocean that is the miracle my infant apostle nothing is clearer than that all things are in all things and that just according to the intensity and extension of our mental being we shall see the many in the one and the one in the many did sir isaac think what he was saying when he made his speech about the ocean the child and the pebbles you know did he mean to speak slightingly of a pebble of a spherical solid which stood sentinel over its compartment of space before the stone that became the pyramids had grown solid and has watched it until now a body which knows all the currents of force that traverse the globe which holds by invisible threads to the ring of saturn and the belt of orion a body from the contemplation of which an archangel could infer the entire inorganic universe as the simplest of corollaries a throne of the allpervading deity who has guided its every atom since the rosary of heaven was strung with beaded stars this is sufficiently plausible and yet light in weight the style shares what we are apt to think the typical american defect of overingenuity and an uneasy love of decoration as though they had not yet learnt the art of sitting still the universe to him as he says swam in an ocean of similitudes and analogies but the imaginative power which is thus implied is often more simply and more happily displayed the sight of old things inspires him or memories of boyhood now the sloopofwar the wasp captain blakely after gloriously capturing the reindeer and the avon had disappeared from the face of the ocean and was supposed to be lost but there was no proof of it and of course for a time hopes were entertained that she might be heard from long after the last real chance had utterly vanished i pleased myself with the fond illusion that somewhere on the waste of waters she was still floating and there were years during which i never heard the sound of the great gun booming inland from the navyyard without saying to myself the wasp has come and almost thinking i could see her as she rolled in crumbling the water before her weatherbeaten barnacled with shattered spars and threadbare canvas welcomed by the shouts and tears of thousands this was one of those dreams that i nursed and never told let me make a clean breast of it now and say that so late as to have outgrown childhood perhaps to have got far on towards manhood when the roar of the cannon has struck suddenly on my ear i have started with a thrill of vague expectation and tremulous delight and the longunspoken words have articulated themselves in the minds dumb whisper the wasp has corned the useful virtues are there nevertheless the love of joy in the first place which raced in his blood from the cradle was even more of a virtue when the autocrat was published than it is now there were strict parents who forbade their children to read the book because it made free with the gloomy morality of the time his sincerity too which would show itself in an acrid humour as a young man gives an air of pugnacity to the kindly pages of the autocrat he hated pomp and stupidity and disease it may not be due to the presence of high virtues and yet how briskly his writing moves along we can almost hear him talk taking the words out of ones mouth in his eagerness to get them said much of this animation is due to the easy and almost incessant play of the autocrats humour and yet we doubt whether dr holmes can be called a humorist in the true sense of the word there is something that paralyses the will in humour and dr holmes was primarily a medical man who valued sanity above all things laughter is good as fresh air is good but he retracts instinctively if there is any fear that he has gone too deep i know it is a sin for me to sit and grin that is the kindly spirit that gives his humour its lightness and it must be added its shallowness for when the range is so scrupulously limited only a superficial insight is possible if the world is only moderately ridiculous it can never be very sublime but it is easy enough to account for the fact that his characters have little hold upon our sympathies by reflecting that dr holmes did not write in order to create men and women but in order to state the opinions which a lifetime of observation had taught him we feel this even in the book which has at least the form of a novel in elsie venner he wished to answer the question which he had asked as a child can we be justly punished for an hereditary sin the result is that we watch a skilful experiment all dr holmess humour and learning he kept a live rattlesnake for months and read all printed knowledge about poison play round the subject and he makes us perceive how curious and interesting the case is but for this is the sum of our objections we are not interested in the heroine and the novel so far as it seeks to convince us emotionally is a failure even so dr holmes succeeds as he nearly always does succeed in making us think he presents so many facts about rattlesnakes and provincial life so many reflections upon human life in general with such briskness and such a lively interest in his own ideas that the portentous physiological conception fertilised by a theological idea is as fresh and almost as amusing as the autocrat or the professor the likeness to these works which no disguise of fiction will obscure proves again that he could not as he puts it get cut of his personality but by that we only mean to define his powers in certain respects for personality limits shakespeare himself we mean that he is one of those writers who do not see much more than other people see and yet they see it with some indescribable turn of vision which reveals their own character and serves to form their views into a coherent creed thus it is that his readers always talk of their intimacy with dr holmes they know what kind of person he was as well as what he taught they know that he loved rowing and horses and great trees that he was full of sentiment for his childhood that he liked men to be strong and sanguine and honoured the weakness of women that he loathed all gloom and unhealthiness that charity and tolerance were the virtues he loved and if one could combine them with wit it was so much to the good above all one must enjoy life and live to the utmost of ones powers it reads something like a medical prescription and one does not want health alone nevertheless when the obvious objections are made we need not doubt that it will benefit thousands in the future and they will love the man who lived as he wrote a cookery book independently of the knowledge they convey cookery books such as the cookery book of lady clark oftillypronie arranged and edited by catherine frances frere are delightful to read a charming directness stamps them with their imperative take an uncooked fowl and split its skin from end to end and their massive common sense which stares frivolity out of countenance then apart from the wonderful suggestive power of the words they deal in southdown mutton hares jugged venison fresh strawberries it is pleasant to think of herbs growing on moors hares running in the stubble spices brought with bales of embroidery from the indies and the strings of words themselves often have a beauty such as poets aim at strain it and sweeten to taste with sugar honey or candied eringo root add a few cloves whole pepper salt a bayleaf a sprig of thyme one of marjoram and some parsley then a fingerglass and rose and orange water poured over the guests hands not only are the furs and fruits beautiful in themselves as they lie heaped together on a dutch canvas with a thin venetian glass among them and a necklace of silver balls drooping over the corner of the table but it is a relief to think of anything so practical as cookery the cook gets something done every day she has no time to ask why she cooks or to question the ultimate effect upon the world the plainest cooks are happier than most artists in that they have one dish which they do to perfection a work of genius in its way sir john clarks anxiety lest the reader should infer that because his wife was interested in cookery she was a mere housewife seems to us misplaced it is a genuine art after all calling not only for skill but for virtues of character and the fact that one is interested in any subject whatever it may be makes it all the more likely that one is interested in others from a glance at those three thousand pages of manuscript scored like a shepherds plaid from which miss frere has compiled the present book we can see that to lady clark the kitchen was only one department of life the library was another anecdotes rhymes names of french plays and new books to be read quotations like the quotation from voltaire tout est perdu quand on digere mal cest lestomac qui fait les heureux crowd into the corners of the recipes then too she was cosmopolitan for when her husband was in the diplomatic service she had the chance of knowing many people and of sampling the cookery of europe when any dish interested her she made inquiries of the artist who touched by her intelligence told her what she wanted if this was impossible she sketched her impressions in a notebook thus as miss frere says lady clark may be said to have focussed much of the best cookery of europe in her collection india and turkey each yielded her something royal ladies and ambassadors contributed to the book there is a poets pudding the poet rogers pudding otherwise called lemon pudding brown it with browning lady clark commands cryptically on one occasion do not scruple to add rabbits if it suits a somewhat empty larder is an aside under goose pie and then there is a sentence which reads like an aphorism when a pig is sacrificed for future bacon there is still a good deal for present consumption but the housekeeper confronted in the chill early hours with the formidable what shall we have today maam will rather be assured that lady clarks book is full of suggestions for small houses and simple tables which the ordinary cook will accept gratefully and can carry out triumphantly in saying this we shall have the support of a number of witnesses for lady clarkes wisdom copied and passed from hand to hand like the songs of the early minstrels lies in many a kitchen drawer already even for those who know them this handsome volume in which references to the recipes are made as easy as possible is a far more convenient shape in which to possess them and a much larger public will thank sir john clark for putting his wifes collection at their disposal when tired or dispirited the cook should read the introduction by miss frere and the description which is given there of a scottish household will put energy into her at once sheridan at first sight there may seem some incongruity between ones idea of sheridan and the size of mr sichels volumes nine people out of ten if asked to give you their impression of sheridan would tell you that he wrote three standard plays was famous for his debts his wit and his speech at the trial of warren hastings they would add that he had played a distinguished but not a commanding part as a statesman and flitted through the society of the georgian era a brilliant but slightly intoxicated insect with gorgeous wings but an erratic flight the important aspect of two stout volumes numbering some pages between them seems strangely at variance with such a figure how completely mr sichel corrects the popular view we shall attempt to show but let us insist at once that the heaviness of the volumes is true in a literal sense only and that after reading from cover to cover the importance of his subject seems to demand an even fuller treatment than it was possible to bestow we should like more about the linleys more of sheridans own letters and more of mrs tickell and her sister if only to enlighten the reader as to the extreme interest and complexity of his task and to point out its true nature it is best to read the overture first in which mr sichel seeks to psychologise a temperament and a time at first let us own the clash of contrasts urged with unusual sharpness and precision blinds our eyes to the form which they would reveal simplicity and extravagance generosity and meanness rash confidence and moderation passion and coldness how are we to compose them all into one human shape but later when we begin to understand it appears that the clue to sheridans baffling career must be sought among these contradictory fragments for looked at from the outside the inconsistencies of his life fill us with a sense of dissatisfaction before he was thirty he had written three plays that are classics in our literature then once in parliament he turned to reform and finance and gave up writing altogether the muses of love and satire beckoned to him from parnassus and to the last he persisted in declaring that they and not politics were his true vocation yet his heart stayed in the assembly of the nation and to the last like congreve he slighted his theatrical triumphs his married life which began with two duels on his wifes behalf and ended in an agony of grief as she lay dying in his arms would present a perfect example of devotion were it not that he had been unfaithful while she lived and married again a girl of twenty three years after her death finally his political career is as incomprehensible as the rest for with gifts as orator and statesman that made him famous over europe he never held high office with a character of singular independence he acted equivocally and with a record of devotion to his prince he lost his favour completely and died without a seat dishonoured and in debt nothing tends to make us lose interest in a character so much as the suspicion that there is something monstrous about it and the achievement of mr sichels biography is that it restores sheridan to human size and brings him to life again the first gift that makes itself felt is the gift that is always present and at work but is yet the hardest to recapture the gift of charm there has been nothing like it since the days of orpheus wrote byron it made the boys at harrow love him sumner the headmaster overlooked his mischief because of it it drew the bailiffs in later days to stand behind his chair as for his sister she confessed that she admired i almost adored him in early days his face expressed only the finer part of him its halfheaviness was lit up by the comedy of his smile the audacity of his air and the brilliance of those eyes that were to outshine the rest of him and to look up at the coffin lid as brightly as ever when the mouth and chin had grown coarse as a satyrs there are only two letters from sheridan at harrow and they are both about dress in one he complains that his clothes are so shabby that he is almost ashamed to wear them on sunday in the other he is anxious to have the proper mourning sent him on his mothers death most schoolboys are conventional but in addition to conforming to its laws sheridan liked the world to know that he grieved a year or two later when we come to miss linley and the famous elopement and the duels the romance of sheridans nature blossoms out with curious qualifications he discovered that the beautiful miss linley who sang like an angel was tormented by a man called mathews who was married she had flirted with him as a child and he now pressed her dishonourably sheridan became her knight he snatched her away to france without her parents knowledge and placed her in a convent it is probable that they went through some form of marriage near calais mathews meanwhile proclaimed his rival a liar and a scoundrel in the bath chronicle and sheridan vowed that he would never sleep in england till he had thanked him as he deserved he left miss linley in her fathers hands fought with mathews twice and obliged him to fly the country it is a tale no doubt that might be matched by others of that age but in the romantic arrangement of the plot in the delicate respect with which he treated his charge and in the extravagance of the vow which constrained him to spend the night out of bed at canterbury and to reach his rival starved for want of sleep there are signs of something out of the ordinary nor was his behaviour ordinary in the months of separation that followed in his letters and his lyrics he luxuriated for the passion that finds words has pleasure about it in the shades of his emotion but love also started his brain into activity not only did he work at mathematics make an abstract of the history of england and comment upon blackstone but he thought about the principles upon which the world is run it seemed to him that all the nobler feelings of man which he began to perceive in himself were blunted by civilisation and sighed for the early days when the ties of friendship and of love could with some safety be formed at the first instigation of our hearts now and perhaps throughout his life he believed that ones emotions are supreme and that one should rate the obstacles that thwart them as tokens of bondage he was fond of dreaming about the enchanted world of the arcadia and of the faerie queen liking rather to dwell upon the characters of life as i would wish that they were than as they are and persuading himself that his wish was really a desire to pierce beneath the corruptions of society to the true face of man beneath perhaps he felt that a world so simplified would be easier to live in than ours but can one believe in it he wished to replace all fielding and smollett with knights and ladies but he did not believe in them either the true romantic makes his past out of an intense joy in the present it is the best of what he sees caught up and set beyond the reach of change sheridans vague rapture with the glamour of life was only sufficient to make him discontented sentimental and chivalrous the strange admixture is shown in his behaviour when he was asked to allow his wife for they had married with the consent of her father but to the rage of his to sing publicly for money he refused to agree although they were very poor and large sums were offered it was said that the sight of george iii ogling her decided him and johnson declared he resolved wisely and nobly to be sure but later when he was struggling for a position in london drawingrooms he allowed her to advertise concerts to the nobility and gentry at which she was to sing without taking money he gained a reputation for chivalry for it implied that he cared for his wifes honour more than for gold and spurned a friendship that was brought but then he valued the favour of the great very highly and if it is true that he never cared for money he seldom paid his debts sheridan would do anything to make the world think well of him he would wear intense mourning he would keep a fine establishment he would faint if people wished it he could anticipate the popular desires and exaggerate them brilliantly the actors blood in him which rises on applause like a ship on the waves was responsible for the touch of melodrama but the finer perceptions of artists were his too and these trained to discover emotions beneath small talk and domesticity threw him off his balance in the uproar of the world there is certainly a strange discrepancy between sheridan in private and sheridan in public between his written words and his spoken the three famous plays were written before he took to public life and represent more of him than tradition or the imperfect reports of his speeches can now preserve they show what sheridan thought when there was no public to send the blood to his head the way in which he takes the word honour in the rivals and makes it the jewel of a frightened country bumpkin and the sport of his shrewd servingman assures us that he fought his own duels with a full sense of their absurdity odds blades david cries acres no gentleman will ever risk the loss of his honour i say then answers david it would be but civil in honour never to risk the loss of a gentleman lookee master this honour seems to me to be a marvellous false friend ay truly a very courtierlike servant and so on until honour and the valiant man of honour are laughed out of court together then again we have some reason to believe that sheridan was an unthinking sentimentalist and so slipshod in his morality that he acted upon no reasoned view but used the current conventions if that were so he would have been the last to see the humour of charles surface in the school for scandal the good qualities of this character are lovable only because we know them to be slightly ridiculous we are meant to think it a weak but endearing trait in him that he refuses to sell his uncles picture no hang it ill not part with poor noll the old fellow has been very good to me and egad ill keep his picture while ive a room to put it in and sheridan satirises his own system of generosity by adding to charless offer of a hundred pounds to poor stanley if you dont make haste we shall have some one call that has a better right to the money these are details but they keep us in mind of the acutely sensible side of sheridans temperament he laughs at the vapours of his age at old women sending out for novels from the library at bombastic irishmen picking quarrels for the glory of it at romantic young ladies sighing for the joys of sentimental elopements ladder of ropes conscious moon four horses scotch parson paragraphs in the newspapers the pity is that his irish gift of hyperbole made it so easy for him to heap one absurdity on another to accumulate superlatives and smother everything in laughter mrs malaprop would be more to the point if she could stay her tongue from deranging epitaphs and the play scene in the critic suffers from the same voluble buffoonery but that it has such a rapture of fun in it that we can never cease to laugh the wind whistles the moon rises see they have killd my squirrel in his cage is this a grasshopper ha no it is my whiskerandos you shall not keep him i know you have him in your pocket an oyster may be crossd in love who says a whales a bird m his humour makes one remember that he liked practical jokes it is absolutely free from coarseness the most profound humour is not fit reading for a girls school because innocence is supposed to ignore half the facts of life and however we may define humour it is the most honest of the gifts among other reasons for the morality of the stage in sheridans day may be found the reason that it lacked vigour of every kind sheridan the first of the playwrights was prevented partly by the fact that his audience would not like it and partly by an innate prudery of his owna touch of that sentimentality which led him to prefer unreal characters to real ones from giving a candid account of life he took some thought of appearances even in the study his own view of the stage may be gathered in the first act of the critic having regard to the limitations of an audience which could not brook vanbrugh and congreve one should not dramatise the penal laws or make the stage the school of morality but find the proper sphere for the comic muse in the follies and foibles of society that was sheridans natural province in spite of a fitful longing to write a romantic italian tragedy if we grant that he had not the power which moves us so keenly in congreve of showing how witty people love and lacked the coarse vigour which still keeps the rehearsal alive we are conscious that he has another power of his own sir henry irving found it in his play of human nature mr sichel speaks of his sympathy a sympathy that congreve lacked it is that surely that gives his comedy its peculiar glow it does not spring from insight or from any unusual profundity it lies rather in his power to get on with ordinary people to come into a room full of men and women who know him for the cleverest man of his time and to set them at once at their ease other dramatists would treat such a character as charles surface with condescension for a blockhead or with uneasy respect because of his courage and muscle but sheridan liked him heartily he was his ideal of a good fellow this humanity it was part of his charm as a man still warms his writing and it has another quality which also appeals to us he reminds us sometimes of our modern dramatists in his power to see accepted conventions in a fresh light he tests the current view of honour he derides the education that was given to women he was for reforming the conventions of the stage his interest in ideas was only a faint forecast of our own obsession and he was too true an artist to make any character the slave of a theory a great fastidiousness was one of the many gifts that were halffailings and the more he wrote the less possible it became to make the drama an instrument of reform the school for scandal was polished and polished again after nineteen years he had been unable to satisfy himself with his style the excessive care was fatal it helped to dry up his vein before he had fully explored it and his last comedy affectation has dwindled to a few careful sentences very neatly written in a small copybook an acute sense of comedy does not seem compatible with a reformers zeal and when the success of his plays and the charm of his wife brought him into touch with the rulers of the country the chance of acting among them proved irresistible his success with the great ladies who came to his wifes drawingroom showed him what kind of power might be his he might lead human beings from the first too he had had the political instinct a sense of distress among the people and a desire to make their lives better by improving the laws of the land government for the people through the people and by the people was the creed with which he started his career under the guidance of fox a boyish essay shows how natural it was to him to think of man as a free being oppressed by the laws all laws at present are tyranny all liberty consists in the probability of not being oppressed what assurance have we that we shall not be taxed at eight shillings in the pound no more than the colonies have one of the first causes that attracted him was the cause of the american colonies and he urged passionately their right to independence he resolved to sacrifice every other object to politics and to force myself into business punctuality and information but it is not necessary to trace sheridans parliamentary career mr sichel proves if one can separate them that it was more important than his career as a man of letters and for this reason his second volume is even more interesting than his first what is interesting of course is the spectacle of a man who tries to give some shape to his beliefs and has great opportunities he had to do what he could with questions like that of the american colonists of the irish union of indian government of the french revolution which sprang up one after the other they have come to be facts now lying sunk beneath a heap of results but they were then in the making composed of the united wills of individuals and shaped by the wills of individuals this is one source of interest but it happens very often that we lose sight of the aim in amazement at the spectacle when sheridan entered parliament burke and pitt and fox to take the leaders only gave every question an extraordinary depth and complexity it seems that we are not tracing ideas but watching a gigantic drama like those old homeric combats where the motive may be the sack of troy but in which the episodes represent every phase of human life sometimes the vast range of the fight narrows itself to the will of one man the central figure is undraped and we have to contemplate the absurd or touching spectacle of a gentleman afflicted with the gout a poor bare forked animal touched in his mind too who for the moment represents humanity there are strange anecdotes in the duchess of devonshires diary the king began to go mad and said the prince of wales was dead so women may be honest he made sir george baker go down on his knees to look at the stars he ordered a tye wig and dancd with dr reynolds the courtiers had to pretend that he could play chess when he could only play draughts and that they had all been a little mad and worn strait waistcoats themselves such contrasts abound but if we know enough there appears to be some order in the tumult it is shaped something after a human form we need only observe out of what elements the conduct of a public man is made sheridan in spite of his vanity and irresponsibility had an unwavering sense of something more stable than any private advantage he could look beyond his own life and judge clearly of things to come again and again we find him on the side of reform courageous and unpurchaseable a statesman whose views grew wider as he aged and yet how strangely little traits of character small vices unchecked since boyhood assert themselves and corrupt his actions the speech upon the begums of oude which made great men tremble and women cry with ecstasy lacks something essential for all its thunder of eloquence years afterwards he met warren hastings shook his hand and begged him to believe that political necessity had inspired some of his rage when hastings with great gravity asked him to make that sentence public he could only mutter and get out of it as best he might it is the same with his friendship for the regent he could not care for anything for its own sake the man was a prince girt about with romance and hung with stars and ribbons mrs fitzherbert was a woman beautiful and in distress his sympathies were volatile and he moved in a world of gems and decorations which might be had for the asking yet gold was too gross to tempt him he craved for love confidence and demonstrative affection in the face of the world what he asked he could not get or perhaps he asked it of the wrong people from the first an uneasy note sounds beneath the rest the beautiful mrs sheridan implored him when they began to rise to let his friends know of their poverty he had not the courage to do it and she was led on to bet and to flirt oh my own she wrote him ee cant think how they beat me every night he condoned her frailties with the tact of a perfect gentleman but once in the race there was no standing still the duchess of devonshire lady bessborough lady elizabeth foster all the great ladies and the brilliant young men were there to egg him on at their pressure such a fountain of wit and satire and imagery sprang from his lips as no one else could rival his face might grow fiery and his nose purple but his voice kept its melody to the end yet in spite of all this he was never at his ease and always conscious of a certain misfit when he stood on the down where twenty years before he had fought and lain wounded he considered his situation what an interval had passed since and scarcely one promise that i then made to my own soul have i attempted to fulfil the irregularity of all my life and pursuits the restless contriving temper with which i have persevered in wrong pursuits and passions makes some words erased of which errors is legible reflexion worse to me than even to those who have acted worse he thought he could foresee the too probable conclusion but even his imagination though made intense by sorrow could hardly have foreseen the end perhaps it was the humour of it that he could not have foreseen he became old sherry to the younger generation and was to be met half seas over a disreputable figure but still talking divinely a battered orpheus but still a very polite gentleman a little bewildered by the course of events and somewhat disappointed by his lot he fell into sponging houses escaped ingeniously from the two strange men who had followed him all his life and begged as eloquently as ever with a touch of irish brogue in his voice they are going to put the carpets out of window and break into mrs sheridans room and take me he wrote but was sanguine on the morrow then he lay dying and the prescriptions were unopened in the bare parlour and there were strange people in the hall but so long as life promised adventures sheridan had a part to act and could welcome a future it is not in any event that his tragedy lay for there is something ludicrous in the stupidity of fate which never fits the fortune to the desert and blunts our pain in wonder the tragedy lies in making promises and seeing possibilities and in the sense of failure there at least the pain is without mixture but one does not fail so long as one sees possibilities still and the judgment on our failure is that which byron murmured when he heard that sheridan was dead and praised his gifts and greatness but alas poor human nature maria edgeworth and her circle so far as we can remember miss hill does not ask herself once in the volume before us whether people now read miss edgeworths novels perhaps she takes it for granted that they do or perhaps she thinks that it does not matter the past has an immense charm of its own and if one can show how people lived a hundred years ago one means by that how they powdered their hair and drove in yellow chariots and passed lord byron in the street one need not trouble oneself with minds and emotions indeed we can know very little of the dead when we talk of the different ages of the past we are really thinking of different fashions of dress and different styles of architecture we have an enormous supply of such properties in our minds deposited there by a library of books like this book of miss hills she stamps the figure of a chariot in gold upon her boards as though it helped us to understand miss edgeworth we persuade ourselves that it does and yet we should think it strange if the future biographer of mrs humphry ward and her circle illustrated his meaning by a hansom cab to miss edgeworth herself we may be sure miss hills account of her would seem a little irrelevant and perhaps not very amusing nevertheless we are under the illusion that this enumeration of trifles and names helps us somehow to see her more clearly than before as certainly it produces in us a mild feeling of benevolence and pleasure to miss hill undoubtedly belongs the credit of choosing her illustrations happily so that they excite in us the curious illusion that we are peopling the past for the moment it seems very much alive and yet it is nothing like the life we know the chief difference is that it makes us laugh much more consistently than the present does and that it is composed to a much greater extent of visual impressions of turbans and chariots with nothing inside them miss edgeworth although she lived in ireland sometimes visited london and paris she crossed the channel for the first time in the voyage taking three hours and a half a comparatively quick passage for those days of sailing packets miss hill points out invoking the spell of the past something after all must be invoked when one has a heroine who brought face to face with mme recamier merely remarks mme recamier is of quite an opposite sort though in the first fashion a graceful and decent beauty of excellent character to solidify the chapter one can also quote at length what the poet rogers said about the famous bath and how miss berry admired the famous bed at the same time we cannot believe that maria would have included mme recamier among her circle in common with all the women writers of the eighteenth century miss edgeworth was strikingly modest her habits were such that no one would have taken her for a remarkable person but it is scarcely necessary to be at such pains to prove it she was diminutive in figure plain in feature and wrote demurely at her desk in the family livingroom nevertheless she observed everything and in congenial company talked well upon old french classic literature and listened sympathetically to stories of the revolution moreover she was so sprightly and sensible that young men of fashion both of the light easy enjoyingtheworld style and of the melancholy and byronic were fascinated and let her twit them with impunity she turned the conversation adroitly from politics to wit and ridiculed the fashion for the triste in manner and le vague in poetry one love affair she had with a swedish gentleman called edelcrantz whose understanding was superior and whose manners were mild but on ascertaining that she would have to leave her family and live in sweden if she married him she refused although being exceedingly in love with him she suffered much at the time and long afterwards in may maria edgeworth with her father and stepmother spent some weeks in london the town ran mad to see her at parties the crowd turned and twisted to discover her and as she was very small almost closed above her head she bore it with composure and amusement the general verdict seems to have been lord byrons one would never have guessed that she could write her name whereas her father talked not as if he could write nothing else but as if nothing else was worth writing on the other hand we have miss edgeworth of lord byron i can tell you only that his appearance is nothing that you would remark the obvious thing happened people stared were disappointed laughed goodhumouredly and began to talk of other things her biographer is in the same predicament she has recourse with the rest of the world to mme de stael that lady was lavishing her eloquence upon london report said that when she was silent that is while her hair was dressed and while she breakfasted she continued to scribble she extorted four words from that duke of marlborough who was scarcely known to speak let me go away he cried on hearing her announced unfortunately napoleon escaped from elba and miss edgeworth withdrew to ireland and for some reason we hear much more of mme darblays impressions of the battle of waterloo than of a much more interesting subject miss edgeworth herself maria took no part in the campaign save that she describes from hearsay a banquet given at drogheda by the lord mayor at which the victorious generals were represented in sugared paste perverse although it may seem drogheda and the opinion of drogheda upon the victory interests us far more than the account of wellingtons reception in paris possibly if we were told what miss edgeworth saw among the peasants on her estate we should realise far better what waterloo meant than by reading the faded exclamations of mme darblay upon the spot europe settled down again however and maria was able to visit hampstead in and to stay with miss joanna baillie the author of plays on the passions and the lyric the chough and crow to roost are gone admired by scott in spite of her fame she too was modest no one could have taken her for a married woman an innocent maiden grace hovered over her to the end of old age she walked discreetly behind her elder sister when the two old ladies dressed in grey silk and lace caps alike were present at the reading of one of joannas plays on the passions in the assembly rooms on hearing of it some of her friends were shocked and wrote have ye heard that jocky baillie has taken to the public line there was mrs barbauld also who sometimes stayed at hampstead and was severely reproved by the quarterly review for her ode by which she depressed the spirits of the nation there was lady breadalbane who fell asleep in her carriage and was locked up in the coach house nobody missing her for a considerable time several carriages were rolled in after hers and then she wakened but what she said maria has no time to report there was mr standish the tiptop dandy who stayed at trentham and displayed such a toilettable that all the ladies maids were invited to a private view of his dressingcase which i assure you my lady is the thing best worth seeing in this house all of gilt plate and i wish my lady you had such a dressingboxi how charming out ancestors were so simple in their manners so humorous in their behaviour so strange in their expressions thus as we run through miss hills book we pick up straws everywhere and dull must be our fancy if we fail in the end to furnish all the georgian houses in existence with tables and chairs and ladies and gentlemen there is no need to tease ourselves with the suspicion that they were quite different in the flesh and as ugly as complex and as emotional as we are for their simplicity is more amusing to believe in and much easier to write about nevertheless there are moments when we bewail the opportunity that miss hill seems to have missed the opportunity of getting at the truth at the risk of being dull the girlhood of queen elizabeth there is a memorable passage at the end of froudes history in which before summing up the qualities of the great queen and delivering judgment he bids us consider what it is to be a sovereign their mean thoughts rise like accusing spirits out of the private drawers of statesmens cabinets they may not stand aside but must always act their duties cling to them as their shadows their words and deeds live after them and must bear a scrutiny to which few could look forward without dismay having pronounced this warning he goes on to strip elizabeth of every virtue that was claimed for her save the virtue of her supreme bravery in some degree such seems to be the fate of the majority of rulers of whom we can form a judgment human nature when set upon a throne seems unable to sustain the enormous enlargement the very early kings alone in whom courage was the essential virtue are dubbed the good the later ones grown subtle are deformed by vice stupidity or bigotry and yet partly because it is extraordinary the spectacle of royalty never fails to surprise us to see the pageant is strange enough but it is far stranger to look into the mind of one of the great actors themselves and to watch the normal human being struggling an ant laden with a pebble beneath the superhuman burden laid upon it by its fellows the difficulty of framing an opinion arises from the necessity that such a person is under of conforming to an unnatural standard so that it is only at rare moments that one can see how he behaves as an individual for the rest one must use ones imagination mr rait in introducing the present volume of queen elizabeths private letters enumerates other difficulties that must beset the student of early documents with their formalities and encumbrances the very language they write is different from ours they have a thousand inducements to tell lies nor can they always tell the truth if they wish it but allowing for all obstacles it remains true he proceeds that in such letters as are contained in this book we have the very marrow of history by the very marrow in this case we mean the temperament of the woman who ruled england from the time she was twentyfive and whose whims and qualities lay at the centre of the vast expansion of the elizabethan age if we can arrive at some knowledge of her nature and of the circumstances that formed it we shall read our history with a greater understanding and mr mumbys collection gives us a splendid chance at least by laying the original matter out of which history is fashioned before us he has restricted himself to supply the necessary links as briefly and as lucidly as possible the story from the first is strange and violent her birth made enemies of her own kinsmen for on that account her halfsister was degraded of her title and shorn of her household then three years later elizabeth was deposed in her turn without a mother and left in the hands of a governess who confessed that she did not know what to do with her the princess she wrote had scarcely any clothes and it was not good for a child of three who had great pain with her great teeth and they come very slowly forth to sup every day at the board of estate for there she shall see divers meats and fruits and wine which it would be hard for me to restrain her grace from it was the third stepmother catherine parr who first noticed her and encouraged her to learn elizabeth aged eleven recognising her fervent zeal towards all goodly learning dedicated to her a translation which she had made of the mirror or glass of the sinful soul making allowance for the constraint put upon her one may infer that elizabeth was a very precocious and somewhat priggish child whose precocity was sometimes disagreeable at the age of fourteen she was ripe for a serious flirtation with her stepmothers husband thomas seymour and was so outspoken in this precocious lovemaking as to bring all those concerned into trouble and herself finally to disgrace yet though elizabeth was forward enough according to her governess it seems pitiable that a girl of that age should have her feelings made the subject of inquisition by a council of noblemen she subdued her passions and in the retreat at hatfield vanity drove her to excel in the only direction now open to her grave scholars like william grindal and roger ascham had been her tutors from the first and had predicted great things of that noble imp at the end of her sixteenth year ascham reckoned up her accomplishments and stated that she could speak french and italian like english latin and greek she could speak with fluency she had read some of cicero livy and sophocles she liked a style that was chaste in its propriety and beautiful in perspicuity but greatly admired metaphors at that age her tutor says she preferred simple dress to show and splendour this was one stage in her development such an educational one was enough to isolate her from her sex save for the halfdozen noble ladies the greys and the cecils who were also prodigies then when mary came to the throne she had to summon all her ability and the composure which learning gives in order to devise a policy and steer like a ship in tempestuous weather between the two parties the protestant party endangered her by their favouritism and made her the queens most serious rival every movement was watched after wyatts conspiracy the queens nerve was so much shaken that she dared the peoples rage and sent elizabeth to the tower the three years that followed were sufficient to give her the habit of telling lies all her life but the memory of her unhappiness was bitter enough also to rouse in her the one sustained and generous feeling of her life she showed mr froude thinks true pity for the queen of scots when years afterwards she too lay in prison to be cold and unemotional the faults with which elizabeth is oftenest charged was the natural refuge for a woman of powerful intellect in the midst of spies to think perpetually and never to act without a motive was the one safe policy but it makes it unusually difficult to arrive at her genuine feeling thus some one wishing to endow the magnificent young woman with human tenderness suggests that she was really fond of children because when she walked in the tower garden she liked to play with a child of four who gave her flowers yet it was at once suspected that her motive was not tender after all but that letters from courtenay lay hid among the leaves perhaps it is a trifle yet it is our certain knowledge of the incidents of life that inspires our conception of character for there is much less individuality in the way great acts are done it would be interesting to know how far we still make use of tradition in giving colour to the great figures of the past when we are without details but there are more definite statements about her appearance she was tall with a swarthy skin and fine eyes above all a beautiful hand of which she makes display she liked to have it said that she resembled her father for she prides herself on her father and glories in him in manner it is probable that she was overbearing and argumentative insisting from vanity in talking italian to italians and because she spoke it better than mary thus at the age of twentythree she was a remarkable personage impressing the venetian ambassador by her intellect and by her astute and judicious behaviour and a perpetual menace to her sister some of the most interesting letters in the collection are the bedingfeld papers concerning her imprisonment at woodstock which froude it seems had never read they show that sir henry bedingfeld far from illtreating her as is commonly said very much disliked his task and did what he could to help her but elizabeth was a formidable prisoner very observant silent if crossed capable of a most unpleasant manner and so royal in her demeanour that it seemed impertinent to restrain her there was nothing for her to do save to embroider the covers of a bible and scratch plaintive verses on the window panes she asked for books a cicero and an english bible she wanted to walk freely and demanded to write her complaints to the council sir henry had to check her in every way he was made uneasy if a servant bringing presents of freshwater fish and two dead pheasant cocks stayed too long gossiping with the servants but such was the tone in which she issued an importunate command that in spite of all injunctions sir henry not only gave her pen and paper but wrote at her dictation although he spelt very badly the princess saying that she never wrote to your lordships but by a secretary he pointed out the inconveniences of woodstock as a residence in winter how the wind and rain would come through the chinks and how the villagers grumbled already at the soldiers who were quartered upon them it is clear that he only wished to be rid of her when mary died three years later no more seasoned woman of her age could be found in europe than elizabeth she had known love and seen death very close she had learnt to suspect almost every one and to let men struggle and plot before her without taking part her intellect was trained to wrestle with intricate arguments and to delight in flourishes of ornament her poverty had taught her to hoard money and to hint for gifts in short her education and her adventures had equipped her with a complete armour of cold and harsh feelings under the control of a perfectly dauntless bravery thus splendid and inscrutable she rode through london on the day of her coronation arches pyramids and fountains stood in her way from which boys sang greeting a fine snow kept falling over her but the gems and the golden collars shone clearly through the whiteness lady hester stanhope the writers in the dictionary of national biography have a pleasant habit of summing up a life before they write it in one word thus stanhope lady hester lucy eccentric the reason why her life is written at all is that she differed from other people but never converted them to her own way of thinking mrs roundell who has written the latest account of her is sympathetic and respectful but she is clearly no convert one feels that she is smoothing over eccentricities as though we were all at a teaparty together it would be polite there to remark lady hester is very fond of cats but in private and writing is private one should allow oneself to luxuriate in the fact that she kept fortyeight of them choosing them for the harmony of their stars with her own joining in a deep bass voice with their music at night and accusing her doctor of a lumpish cold effeminate disposition if he found the noise intolerable but the merit of mrs roundells work together with its simplicity and its quotations from later writers is that it brings or recalls to our notice a most entertaining book the memoirs and travels of lady hester stanhope by dr meryon in six volumes the charm of dr meryons work lies in its comprehensiveness he lived with her off and on for twentyeight years and the people we live with are the last we seek to define in one word dr meryon never attempted it to him she was not an eccentric by profession but a lady of exalted birth who condescended when she shook hands with him a woman of political greatness inspired at times with a spell like circe as a middle class englishman as a doctor as a man respecting womans courage but a little touched by the need for it he felt her charm she treated him like a servant but the magical illusion which she ever contrived to throw around herself in the commonest circumstances of life kept its glamour happily the conditions of life on mount lebanon in the thirties of the last century allowed him to write profusely and gave him only the one subject to treat when he got back at dawn from those long audiences by the end of which the lady was hidden in smoke he tried to put down the stories and to express the kind of stupefaction with which she overwhelmed him very little unfortunately is known of ladys hesters early life when she kept house for william pitt she made herself disliked presumably from the account that she gives of her triumphs with a scanty education but great natural force she despised people without troubling to give them a reason for it intuition took the place of argument and her penetration was great fort grande fort maigre fort decidee fort independante a french lady describes her as girl in the ballroom she herself recalled her complexion of alabaster and her lips of carnation further she had a conviction of the rights of the aristocracy and ordered her life from an eminence which made her conduct almost sublime principle she exclaimed what do you mean by principle am a pitt unluckily her sex closed the proper channels if you were a man hester mr pitt would say i would send you on the continent with men and give you carte blanche and i am sure that not one of my plans would fail and not one soldier would go with his shoes unblacked but as it was her powers fermented within her she detested her sex as though in revenge for the limitations with which ordinary women cramp remarkable ones and drove herself as near madness as one can go by feeding a measureless ambition upon phantoms when her uncle died she had a pension of fifteen hundred a year and a house in montague square but she pointed out in a remarkable conversation how these conditions are precisely the most intolerable if you are a person of rank they condemn you to nothing less than imprisonment in your own drawingroom for you cannot do yourself justice in the streets upon such a pittance she preferred to sacrifice her health rather than lower her standards until it occurred to her that simplicity so extreme that no one can connect it with necessity is the other way of being distinguished accordingly she retired to a cottage at builth in wales where she lived in a room not more than a dozen feet square curing the poor and keeping a dairy she was then thirtytwo with a mixture of true greatness and grandiloquence she determined that english ways of life are made to suit timid herds and that a remarkable person must seek a land less corrupted by hypocrisy where nature prevails with what expectations she set sail for the east we know not but she emerged in syria astride her horse in the trousers of a turkish gentleman for the rest of her life she did nothing but shake her fist at england where the people had forgotten their great men as usual her sublimity was accompanied by a touch of the ridiculous it is impossible not to feel that the presence of mrs fry the respectable english maid impaired the romance of the cavalcade dressed in mens clothes she was expected to ride like a man but with the heroism of her class she persisted in sitting in the decorous posture customary with women in england and was thus often exposed to the danger of falling from her ass then how pathetic were her attempts to redeem the wild eastern names to the semblance at least of christianity philippaki became philip parker and mustapha mr farr lady hester and dr meryon saw nothing in this but the feebleness of a womanish disposition a convent on the slopes of mount lebanon was bought and there lady hester settled down to exert her mysterious spells all round the house which was perched on the top of a hill she dug an elaborate garden from whose terraces one could see the mediterranean between the hills her influence at one time was vast though vague the children for twenty miles round constantinople had heard her name the apparition of this englishwoman with her large frame and her cadaverous face and her connection with august personages in england was in itself a miracle the natives thought her neither man nor woman but a being apart the chiefs came to her for counsel because she was absolutely without fear and loved to intrigue the english consuls all along the coast held her in horror sitting on her hilltop she thought that she arranged the affairs of the countryside and overheard the faintest whispers a sponge diver called logmagi was sent to pick up news in the seaports and the bazaars of constantinople and in particular to report the first tidings of unrest among the people at once new rooms and secret tunnels were added to the house till it was shaped like a labyrinth for she believed that events and catastrophes would come to pass when people of all nations would fly to her and she would lead them forth to jerusalem itself mounted upon one of the two sacred mares which now fattened in her stalls upon the other a boy without a father would ride who was none other than the messiah himself for some time the duke of reichstadt was the boy of the prophecy but when he died she fixed on another talk since nothing ever happened became the solace of her life the memoirs are made out of talk wrapped in a white cloak with a great turban on her head she sat in the dusk so that you might not notice how her skin was wrinkled like the network which we see on the rind of some species of melons picking spoonfuls of meat and sweetstuff from saucers and pouring forth her soliloquy nothing that had happened in the years she lived with mr pitt was forgotten she remembered how she had snubbed admiral what the duchess of d had worn what a leg had sir w r in particular how mr pitt had praised her and how he liked his food she gossiped as though she were talking over the events of the night before although she sat among broken crockery in the syrian mountains smoking pipes with her doctor twenty years or more after it had all faded away thus she rambled on what can be the reason i am now always thinking of sir g h i have been thinking how well he would do for master of the horse to the queen and i have a good way of giving a hint of it through the buckleys for i always said that next to lord chatham nobody ever had such handsome equipages as sir g nobodys coaches and horses were so neatly picked out as theirs sir g is a man doctor from what you tell me that would have just suited mr pitt that polished and quiet manner which sir g has was what mr pitt found so agreeable in mr long it is very odd mr pitt always would dress for dinner even if we were alone one day i said to him you are tired and there is no one but ourselves why need you dress he replied why i dont know hester but if one omits to do it today we neglect it tomorrow and so on until one grows a pig her spirits fell and she went on to look at me now what a lesson against vanity look at this arm all skin and bone so thin so thin that you may see through it and once without exaggeration so rounded that you could not pinch the skin up my neck was once so fair that a pearl necklace scarcely showed on it and men no fools but sensible men would say to me god has given you a neck you really may be proud of you are one of natures favourites and one may be excused for admiring that beautiful skin if they could behold me now with my teeth all gone and with long lines in my face not wrinkles for i have no wrinkles when i am left quiet and not made angry but my face is drawn out of composure by these wretches i thank god that old age has come upon me unperceived when i used to see the painted lady h dressed in pink and silver with her head shaking and jumped by her footman into her sociable attempting to appear young i felt a kind of horror and disgust i cant describe i wonder how lady stafford dresses now she is no longer young but i cant fancy her grown old fierce storms of rage possessed her and then she would weep with a wild howl painful to hear as though bellona should weep more and more as time passed without any revolution and her influence waned and debts crushed her did she seek the support of magic although she had failed to subdue the forces of this world and the queen and lord palmerston were against her she was mistress of arts that the vulgar knew nothing of she saw the sylphs perched on her chest of drawers and clumsy fellows tripped up for ignoring them seated in the convent at dar djoun she could look into the heart of paris or of london she knew the cavern where the king of the serpents lived with the head of a man she knew where to find the lost book of adam and eves language written in letters a span high i believe in vampires but the people in england know not how to distinguish them after a time she never left her hilltop then she scarcely went beyond her room but sat in bed arguing scolding and ringing bells perpetually the floor littered with pipes and bits of string she was never to ride into jerusalem upon her mare and the aristocratic ideal remained high she would let no european come near her and at last she turned even dr meryon away in june the news came to beirut that she had died with only native servants round her rooms were found full of mouldy stores hoarded for the great emergency but her valuables had been stolen while she lay helpless the dead lady looked composed and placid but she was so much in the habit of hiding her feelings that her expression told nothing she was buried in a corner of her rose garden in the grave of a certain prophet where she had not wished to be buried ten years later the place was a thicket of brambles and roses now there are lines of mulberry trees but lady hester the last of the great english aristocrats lives on in despite of the plough modes and manners of the nineteenth century when one has read no history for a time the sadcoloured volumes are really surprising that so much energy should have been wasted in the effort to believe in something spectral fills one with pity wars and ministries and legislation unexampled prosperity and unbridled cor ruption tumbling the nation headlong to decay what a strange delusion it all is invented presumably by gentlemen in tall hats in the forties who wished to dignify mankind our point of view they ignore entirely we have never felt the pressure of a single law our passions and despairs have nothing to do with trade our virtues and vices flourish under all governments impartially the machine they describe they succeed to some extent in making us believe in it but the heart of it they leave untouched is it because they cannot understand it at any rate we are left out and history in our opinion lacks an eye it is with unusual hope that we open the three volumes in which a nameless author has dealt with the modes and manners of the nineteenth century thin and green with innumerable coloured pictures and a fair type they are less like a mausoleum than usual and modes and manners how we feel and dress are precisely what the other historian ignores the connection between dress and character has been pointed out often enough because dress represents some part of a man picturesquely it lends itself happily to the satirist he can exaggerate it without losing touch with the object of his satire like a shadow it walks beside the truth and apes it the device of making the smaller ridicule the greater by representing it recommended itself to swift and carlyle but to discover soberly how far thought has expressed itself in clothes and manners as we call them is far more difficult there is the temptation to hook the two together by the most airy conjectures a gentleman had the habit for example of walking in the streets of berlin with tame deer that was characteristic we are told of a certain middleclass section of german society in the twenties thirties and forties which was learned pedantic philistine and vulgar for to make oneself conspicuous is a mark of the vulgarian and to walk with tame deer is to make oneself conspicuous but there are more solid links the french revolution of course sundered the traditions of ages it decreed that man in future must be mainly black and should wear trousers instead of breeches the waistcoat alone remained aristocratic and drew to itself all the reds and oranges of the other garments and as they became cotton turned to plush and brocade at length this rich territory was conquered and sparks of colour only burnt in the cravat and on the fob the different garments moved up and down swelled and shrank at intervals but after a mans clothes were essentially the same as they are now men wished to obliterate classes and a dress that could be worn became necessary women on the other hand were exposed to fewer influences so that it may be easier to trace one idea in their clothes the effect of the revolution seems to be definite enough rousseau had bidden them return to nature the revolution had left them poor the greeks were ancient and therefore natural and their dress was cheap enough for a democracy accordingly they dressed in pure white cottons and calicoes without a frill or an exuberance nature alone was to shape the lines nature was to suffer not more than eight ounces of artificial concealment the effect of these tapering nymphs dancing on a hilltop among slim trees is exquisite but chill because greek temples were white they whitewashed their walls the bedroom was the temple of sleep the tables were altars the chair legs were grooved into columns reticules were shaped like funeral urns and classical cameos were worn at the neck the absolute consistency of their attitude may be ridiculous but it is also remarkable in fact the society of the empire is the last to boast a style of its own owing to the perfect correspondence between its aims ideas and character and their outward manifestations any unanimity is overwhelming it is one of the great gifts we bestow upon the greeks and although there were many beautiful episodes in the nineteenth century no single style was again strong enough to make everything consistent before the revolution some sort of order was stamped upon fashion by the will of the queen who could afford to make beauty the prime virtue but in mile bertin marie antoinettes modiste fled from paris and although she touched at other courts eventually settling in england her rule was over shops for readymade clothing opened as she left for ten years the didactic classic spirit served instead of the royal will and then a confusion set in which threatens never to grow calm still the author does his best to make one change account for another at the risk of wide generalisations feeling and sensibility took the place in this generation the generation of the napoleonic wars of religion during the first empire love and passion had been but the passing gratification of the moment but now love was to be the one lasting object of life and being therefore puffs and ruffs were worn the furniture became rococo and gothic cathedrals influenced the chairs and the clocks a womans clothes are so sensitive that far from seeking one influence to account for their changes we must seek a thousand the opening of a railway line the marriage of a princess the trapping of a skunk such external events tell upon them then there is the relationship between the sexes in the empress eugenie wearing a short skirt for the first time went for a drive with the emperor and empress of austria as the ladies stepped into the carriage the emperor turned to his wife and said take care or some one may catch sight of your feet the influences of beauty and of reason are always fighting in a womans clothes reason has won some remarkable triumphs in germany for the most part but generally submits to a weak compromise when we talk of fashion however we mean something definite though hard to define it comes from without we wake in the morning and find the shops alive with it soon it is abroad in the streets as we turn over the pictures in these volumes we see the spirit at work it travels all over the body ceaselessly now the skirt begins to grow until it trails for six feet upon the ground suddenly the spirit leaps to the throat and creates a gigantic ruff there while the skirt shrinks to the knees then it enters the hair which immediately rises in the pinnacles of salisbury cathedral a slight swelling appears beneath the skirt it grows alarmingly at last a frame has to support the flounces next the arms are attacked they imitate chinese pagodas steel hoops do what they can to relieve them the hair meanwhile has subsided the lady has outgrown all cloaks and only a vast shawl can encompass her suddenly without warning the entire fabric is pricked the spirit moves the empress eugenie one night january to reject her crinoline in an instant the skirts of europe melt away and with pursed lips and acrimonious manners the ladies mince about the streets clasped tightly round the knees instead of swimming it is from the crinoline no doubt that meredith got his favourite she swam fashion dealt more discreetly with men and chiefly haunted their legs nevertheless there was a sympathy between the sexes when her skirts ballooned his trousers swelled when she dwindled away he wore stays when her hair was gothic his was romantic when she dragged a train his cloak swept the ground about his waistcoat was more uncontrollable than any garment of hers five times within eight months it changed its shape for a long time the cravat preserved a space for jewellery where the necklaces were rivalled the only parts of men that survived the stark years of the thirties and forties were the hat and the beard they still felt the sway of political changes the democratic spirit required felt hats that drooped in they dissolved about the ears stiffening again as reaction set in the same principle ruled the beard to be clean shaven was a sign of unflinching respectability a ragged beard or even a beard alone showed that ones opinions were out of control at the present time only at home does the gentleman indulge in coloured goldlaced velvet silk or cashmere when he appears in public he may only venture by the superior cut of his garments to aim at any distinction if the male attire thereby loses in effect it gains in tone with furniture we find the same thing quite slowly every chair and table round us changes its form if one had fallen asleep in an early victorian drawingroom among the patterns and plush one would wake up this year with a horrid start the room would seem little better than an attic yet if one had sat there openeyed one would scarcely have seen the things change dress and furniture are always moving but having done his utmost to make them depend upon the spirit of the time the author declares himself baffled the longer we study the question the more certain do we become that though we know the how we shall never know the wherefore are we truly in the grip of a spirit that makes us dance to its measure or can it be laid without recourse to magic when one compromises one delivers no clear message throughout the nineteenth century both dress and furniture were at the mercy of a dozen different aims and the original meaning was further blunted by the intervention of machines only great artists giving their minds to nothing else represent their age dressmakers and cabinetmakers generally caricature it or say nothing about it as for manners the term is so vague that it is difficult to test it but it is probable that they too only approximate and that peoples behaviour is the roughest guide to what they mean if manners are not rubbed smooth by a machine the comfort of society depends upon using a common language and only saying what can be misunderstood without disaster for this reason a history of modes and manners must use phrases which are as empty as any in the language and the history is not a history of ourselves but of our disguises the poets and the novelists are the only people from whom we cannot hide emersons journals emersons journals have little in common with other journals they might have been written by starlight in a cave if the sides of the rock had been lined with books in reality they cover twelve most important years when he was at college when he was a clergyman and when he was married for the first time but circumstances as well as nature made him peculiar the emerson family was now threadbare but it had noble traditions in the past his widowed mother and his eccentric aunt were possessed with the fierce puritan pride of family which insisted upon intellectual distinction and coveted with a pride that was not wholly of the other world a high place for their name among the select families of boston they stinted themselves and stinted the boys that they might afford learning the creed of the enthusiastic women was but too acceptable to children born to be educatedz they chopped the firewood read classics in their spare time and lay bare in all their sensitiveness to the pressure of i know not how many literary influences with which the emerson household was charged the influence of aunt mary their fathers sister was clearly the most powerful there are general rough sketches of men of genius in the family and miss emerson rudely represented her nephew she possessed the intense faith of the first americans together with a poetic imagination which made her doubt it her soul was always in conflict she did not know whether she could suffer her nephews to reform the precious fabric and yet was so full of new ideas herself that she could not help imparting them but unlike them she was only selftaught and her fervour boiled within her scalding those she loved best i love to be a vessel of cumbersomeness to society she remarked but the strange correspondence which she kept up with ralph although it is but half intelligible from difficulty of thought and inadequacy of language shows us what an intense and crabbed business life was to a serious american with such voices urging him on emerson went to school fully impressed with the importance of the intellect but his journals do not show vanity so much as a painful desire to get the most out of himself and a precocious recognition of ends to be aimed at his first object was to learn how to write the early pages are written to the echo of great prose long before he could fit words that gave his meaning into the rhythm he studied nature with a classical enthusiasm and the constant activity of his mind endowed him with an energy of thought little short of inspiration then he began to collect rare words out of the books he read conditioned cameleon zeal whortleberry the frigid exercises upon the drama death providence were useful also to decide the anxious question whether he belonged to the society of distinguished men or not but it was the responsibility and the labour of being great and not the joy that impressed him his upbringing had early made him conscious that he was exceptional and school no doubt confirmed him at any rate he could not share his thoughts with friends their arguments and views are never quoted beside his own in the diary the face of one freshman attracted him but it would seem that this was an imaginary friendship there is no evidence that the elder student ever brought himself to risk disenchantment by active advances to make up for the absence of human interest we have the annals of the pythologian club but although they show that emerson occasionally read and listened to papers comparing love and ambition marriage and celibacy town life and country life they give no impression of intimacy compared with the contemporary life of an englishman at oxford or cambridge the life of an american undergraduate seems unfortunately raw shelley took the world seriously enough but oxford was so full of prejudices that he could never settle into complacent selfimprovement cambridge made even wordsworth drunk but the great bare building at harvard which looks in an engraving of io like a reformatory in the middle of a desert had no such traditions its pupils were profoundly conscious that they had to make them several volumes of the journals are dedicated to america as though to a cause a weaker mind shut up with its finger on its pulse would have used a diary to revile its own unworthiness but emersons diary merely confirms the impression he made on his friends he appeared kindly affable but selfcontained apart as if in a tower nor was he more emotional writing at midnight for his own eye but we can guess the reason it was because he had convictions his indefatigable brain raised a problem out of every sight and incident but they could be solved if he applied his intellect safe in this knowledge which time assured he could live alone registering the development relying more and more on his sufficiency and coming to believe that by close scrutiny he could devise a system life at twentyone made him ponder thoughts like these books and men civilisation society and solitude time god within novels romances and plays seemed for the most part written for coxcombs and deficient persons the only voice that reached him from without was the voice of his aunt mary tumultuous in fear lest he should lose his belief in original sin before he had developed his theory of compensation he was sometimes harassed by the existence of evil occasionally he accused himself of wasting time but his composure is best proved by an elaborate essay headed myself there one quality is weighed with another so that the character seems to balance scrupulously yet he was conscious of a signal defect which troubled him because it could destroy this balance more completely than its importance seemed to justify either he was without address or there was a levity of understanding or there was an absence of common sympathies at any rate he felt a sore uneasiness in the company of most men and women i even before women and children i am compelled to remember the poor boy who cried i told you father they would find me out to be a sage in ones study and a stumbling schoolboy out of it that was the irony he had to face instead however of slipping into easier views he went on with his speculations nor was he bitter against the world because it puzzled him what he did was to assert that he could not be rejected because he held the universe within him each man by finding out what he feels discovers the laws of the universe the essential thing therefore is to be as conscious of yourself as possible he that explores the principles of architecture and detects the beauty of the proportions of a column what doth he but ascertain one of the laws of his own mind the kingdom of god is within you t hold fast to my old faith that to each soul is a solitary law a several universe every man is a new creation can do something best has some intellectual modes or forms or a character the general result of all such as no other in the universe has but this is different from selfishness praise or blame or a reflection in the face of society anything that made him remember himself discomfited him a solitude as empty as possible in which he could feel most acutely his contact with the universe rejoiced him the more exclusively idiosyncratic man is the more general and infinite he is that was the justification of solitude but the fruits depend upon the worth of the man small minds imbibing this doctrine turn their possessors into cranks and egoists and a delicate mind is strained until it is too pure to act there was mr bradford for example who too modest and sensitive to be a clergyman became a teacher of classes for young ladies and was a devoted gardener in emerson the reason was strong enough to lift him beyond the temptation of purifying his own soul yet it did not free him in youth at least from an interest in the distempers of his spirit which is unpleasantly professional often in company and in solitude he was absorbed in regulating his sensations when i stamp through the mud in dirty boots i hug myself with the feeling of my immortality only the bland and impersonal spirit which never left him makes such reflections other than smug they are often dismal enough but the wonder is that treating as he does of platitudes and expounding them for our good he yet contrives to make them glow so frequently as if next minute they would illumine the world he had the poets gift of turning far abstract thoughts if not into flesh and blood at least into something firm and glittering in the pages of his diary one can see how his style slowly emerged from its wrappings and became more definite and so strong that we can still read it even when the thought is too remote to hold us he discovered that no man can write well who thinks there is any choice of words for him in good writing every word means something in good writing words become one with things but the theory has something priggish about it all good writing is honest in the sense that it says what the writer means but emerson did not see that one can write with phrases as well as with words his sentences are made up of hard fragments each of which has been matched separately with the vision in his head it is far rarer to find sentences which lacking emphasis because the joins are perfect and the words common yet grow together so that you cannot dismember them and are steeped in meaning and suggestion but what is true of his style is true of his mind an austere life spent in generalising from ones own emotions and in keeping their edges sharp will not yield rich romantic pages so deep that the more you gaze into them the more you see isolated one loses the power of understanding why men and women do not live by rule and the confusion of their feelings merely distresses one emerson born among halftaught people in a new land kept always the immature habit of conceiving that man is made up of separate qualities which can be separately developed and praised it is a belief necessary to schoolmasters and to some extent emerson is always a schoolmaster making the world very simple for his scholars a place of discipline and reward but this simplicity which is in his diaries as well as in his finished works for he was not to be found out is the result not only of ignoring so much but of such concentration upon a few things by means of it he can produce an extraordinary effect of exaltation as though the disembodied mind were staring at the truth he takes us to a peak above the world and all familiar things have shrunk into pinheads and faint greys and pinks upon the flat there with beating hearts we enjoy the sensation of our own dizziness there he is natural and benign but these exaltations are not practicable they will not stand interruption where shall we lay the blame is he too simple or are we too worn but the beauty of his view is great because it can rebuke us even while we feel that he does not understand mrs gaskell from what one can gather of mrs gaskells nature she would not have liked mrs chadwicks book a cultivated woman for whom publicity had no glamour with a keen sense of humour and a quick temper she would have opened it with a shiver and dropped it with a laugh it is delightful to see how cleverly she vanishes there are no letters to be had no gossip people remember her but they seem to have forgotten what she was like at least cries mrs chadwick she must have lived somewhere houses can be described there is a long glasscovered porch forming a conservatory which is the main entrance on the groundfloor to the right is a large drawingroom on the left are a billiardroom a large kitchen and a scullery there are ten bedrooms and a kitchen garden sufficiently large to supply vegetables for a large family the ghost would feel grateful to the houses it might give her a twinge to hear that she had got into the best literary set of the day but on the other hand it would please her to read of how charles darwin was the wellknown naturalist the surprising thing is that there should be a public who wishes to know where mrs gaskell lived curiosity about the houses the coats and the pens of shelley peacock charlotte bronte and george meredith seems lawful one imagines that these people did everything in a way of their own and in such cases a trifle will start the imagination when the whole body of their published writings fails to thrill but mrs gaskell would be the last person to have that peculiarity one can believe that she prided herself upon doing things as other women did them only better that she swept manuscripts off the table lest a visitor should think her odd she was we know the best of housekeepers her standard of comfort writes mrs chadwick being expensive but her tastes were always refined and she kept a cow in her back garden to remind her of the country for a moment it seems surprising that we should still be reading her books the novels of today are so much terser intenser and more scientific compare the strike in north and south for example with the strife of mr galsworthy she seems a sympathetic amateur beside a professional in earnest but this is partly due to a kind of irritation with the methods of midvictorian novelists nothing would persuade them to concentrate able by nature to spin sentence after sentence melodiously they seem to have left out nothing that they knew how to say our ambition on the other hand is to put in nothing that need not be there what we want to be there is the brain and the view of life the autumnal woods the history of the whale fishery and the decline of stage coaching we omit entirely but by means of comment dialogues that depart from truth by their wit and not by their pomposity descriptions fused into a metaphor we get a world carved out arbitrarily enough by one dominant brain every page supplies a little heap of reflections which so to speak we sweep aside from the story and keep to build a philosophy with there is really nothing to stimulate such industry in the pages of thackeray dickens trollope and mrs gaskell a further deficiency in modern eyes is that they lack personality cut out a passage and set it apart and it lies unclaimed unless a trick of rhythm mark it yet it may be a merit that personality the effect not of depth of thought but of the manner of it should be absent the tuft of heather that charlotte bronte saw was her tuft mrs gaskells world was a large place but it was everybodys world she waited to begin her first novel until she was thirtyfour driven to write by the death of her baby a mother a woman who had seen much of life her instinct in writing was to sympathise with others loving men and women she seems to have done her best like a wise parent to keep her own eccentricities in the background she would devote the whole of her large mind to understanding that is why when one begins to read her one is dismayed by the lack of cleverness carriages still roll along the streets concerts are still crowded by subscribers the shops for expensive luxuries still find daily customers while the workman loiters away his unemployed time in watching these things and thinking of the pale uncomplaining wife at home and the wailing children asking in vain for enough of food of the sinking health of the dying life of those near and dear to him the contrast is too great why should he alone suffer from bad times i know that this is not really the case and i know what is the truth in such matters but what i wish to impress is what the workman feels and thinks so she misses the contrast but by adding detail after detail in this profuse impersonal way she nearly achieves what has not been achieved by all our science because they are strange and terrible to us we always see the poor in stress of some kind so that the violence of their feeling may break through conventions and bringing them rudely into touch with us do away with the need of subtle understanding but mrs gaskell knows how the poor enjoy themselves how they visit and gossip and fry bacon and lend each other bits of finery and show off their sores this is the more remarkable because she was hampered by a refined upbringing and traditions of culture her working men and women her outspoken and crabbed old family domestics are generally more vigorous than her ladies and gentlemen as though a touch of coarseness did her good how admirable for instance is the scene when mrs boucher is told of her husbands death hoo mun be told because of th inquest see hoos coming round shall you or i do it or mappen your father would be best no you you said margaret they awaited her perfect recovery in silence then the neighbour woman sat down on the floor and took mrs bouchers head and shoulders on her lap neighbour said she your man is ded guess yo how he died he were drowned said mrs boucher feebly beginning to cry for the first time at this rough probing of her sorrow he were found drowned he were coming home very hopeless o aught on earth im not saying he did right and im not saying he did wrong all i say is may neither me nor mine ever have his sore heart or we may do like things he has left me alone w a these children moaned the widow less distressed at the manner of the death than margaret expected but it was of a piece with her helpless character to feel his loss as principally affecting herself and her children too great a refinement gives cranford that prettiness which is the weakest thing about it making it superficially at least the favourite copy for gentle writers who have hired rooms over the village postoffice when she was a girl mrs gaskell was famous for her ghost stories a great storyteller she remained to the end able always in the middle of the thickest book to make us ask what happens next keeping a diary to catch the overflow of life observing clouds and trees moving about among numbers of very articulate men and women highspirited observant and free from bitterness and bigotry it seems as though the art of writing came to her as easily as an instinct she had only to let her pen run to shape a novel when we look at her work in the mass we remember her world not her individuals in spite of lady ritchie who hails molly gibson dearest of heroines a born lady unconsciously noble and generous in every thought in spite of the critics praise of her psychological subtlety her heroes and heroines remain solid rather than interesting with all her humour she was seldom witty and the lack of wit in her characterdrawing leaves the edges blunt these pure heroines having no such foibles as she loved to draw no coarseness and no violent passions depress one like an old acquaintance one will never get to know them and that is profoundly sad one reads her most perhaps because one wishes to have the run of her world melt them together and her books compose a large bright country town widely paved with a great stir of life in the streets and a decorous row of old georgian houses standing back from the road leaving behind your husband children and civilisation you must come out to barbarism loneliness and liberty thus charlotte bronte inviting her to haworth compared their lives and mrs gaskells comment was poor miss bronte we who never saw her with her manner gay but definite her beautiful face and her almost perfect arm find something of the same delight in her books what a pleasure it is to read them the duke and duchess of newcastleupontyne some one has probably written a story in which the hero is for ever thinking about the dead it troubles him that people think of them so little he is always wondering what he ought to do for them then he wonders whether it really needs more imagination to believe in the present or in the past becoming obsessed by the idea he spends his life in reading volume after volume he discovers that great men had uncles and aunts and cousins he dives after them so to speak and rescues them by the hair of their heads it is another form of philanthropy after all when he comes to think of it he cares much more genuinely for the late duchess of newcastle than for the old woman who cleans his stairs he thinks about her all day what else is affection indeed affection for the living is generally a far more hazardous business than this the living change and lie and drop one all the arguments in short are on his side and finally outraged by contact with unreal fugitive fleshencumbered live people he draws his razor and departs that there is some truth in this unhappy story no one who owns a library will deny the anonymous author of this book is evidently touched by the feeling it is that which keeps his narrative so fresh one can imagine that it makes him uneasy to sit beside books for long he hears people talking in them and must let them out to do this one must get at them see them make them talk sense a fascinating employment although not without its risks fortunately there is generally some obstacle to prevent us from crashing through the little plank on which we stand into the immense abyss there is the difficulty of language when the duke of newcastle was in exile he was very deeply in debt but wished to leave paris that day writes the duchess when we left paris the creditors coming to take their farewell of my lord expressed so great a love and kindness for him accompanied with so many prayers and wishes that he could not but prosper on his journey no wonder the editor exclaims it is easy to understand that they would be anxious to have a few words with him perhaps a good many words and to come to a very clear understanding before losing sight of him love and kindness indeed yet our impression is that the duchess was subtle in her language and that the editor is polishing the bloom off they were formal obsequious citizens abashed by nobility in distress and not seedylooking men in black coats ready to whip one off in a fourwheeler to the police court that is the kind of difficulty that makes it heartbreaking sometimes to read of the ancient dead with all our knowledge of literary history we do not know what our ancestors thought about writing far more direct of speech than we are not one of their written sentences could have been spoken by the lips it may be that writing was always connected in their minds with legal business certainly the style survives in the letters one receives from solicitors banks and men of business in general but where our formal style is purely vicious theirs is often beautiful and characteristic as though the soul were different and not the manner looking about for a modern figure to compare with the first duke of newcastle we find no one who will do if we could find a rich nobleman amorous in poetry music and art a bit of a poet though not much of a scholar we should not find him in command of the army in time of war he would finance an opera house but to be born about the year and to be the fruit of a succession of fortunate marriages put one in a position which we can barely conceive cavendish going to cambridge at fourteen learnt there how to manage horses and weapons he left at eighteen finding the food bad and the disputations of the hungry scholars wracking to the brain next he visited savoy in the suite of sir henry wotton and began to write verses like his master although he entirely concealed the scholar under the more taking appearance of the fine gentleman his fathers death left him very wealthy and a personage at court if for instance king charles was making a progress and passed near welbeck newcastle would invite him to dinner ben jonson would be sent for to write a masque the country gentry would be called in and four or five thousand pounds would be spent upon the feasting in this way he mounted the steps of the peerage and bought the post of governor to the kings son money it may be could do as much for a nobleman now but he would surely have to specialise possibly that is where we differ owing to the scarcity of rich men and the subjection of the poor a fortunate human being had space to grow in we see how gorgeously newcastles tastes were fed with a taste for poetry and art he had vandyke suckling and ben jonson for friends with a taste for diplomacy he served under wotton and was in the counsels of his king with a taste for riding he became commander of the army in the north against cromwell with sublime confidence in the virtues of gentle birth he made those qualities go as far as they could in acts of courtesy affability bounty and generosity he abounded but the substantial part and fatigue of a general he did not in any degree understand being utterly unacquainted with war nor could submit to having risked his life like a gentleman he retired like a gentleman to enjoy his music he chose poets for captains davenant was his general of artillery because he was a poet the church was represented by the rev mr hudson who being a very able divine became scout master general of the army duty to royalty made him waive his own opinion and fight at marston moor happen what may he declared i will not shun to fight for i have no other ambition than to live and die a loyal subject of his majesty accordingly he drove behind the army to marston moor in his state coach and six having reached the field he lit his pipe sank upon the cushions and slept until the attack should begin directly he heard the pistols and the shouting he sprang up and with a little halfleaden sword belonging to his page ran three scots through the body himself he stayed on the field to the end and then escaped to holland in excuse for his flight it must be said that he had spent all his fortune save ninety pounds upon the cause and that he had proved that this kind of war wanted a different sort of general his edge a friend said had too much razor in it for he had a tincture of a romantic spirit and had the misfortune to have somewhat of the poet in him it may have been the poet the comic poet that fell in love in paris with that eccentric maid of honour margaret lucas it may have been as the author is inclined to think his inherited instinct for a good match why the dead loved and how is one of those points that we finger but leave unsolved they cannot explain it only so soon after shakespeare wrote there must have been people who fell in love for no reason whatever margaret lucas was not happy at court she was often lost in thought have snails got teeth do hogs have the measles why do dogs that rejoice swing their tails it was a bad habit in the eyes of the french ladies one of the pleasant things about newcastle is that he seems to have allowed her to go on with these investigations without bullying her although she brought him no children his manage it may be took up all his thoughts enraged too with his great work a new method and extraordinary invention to dress horses cls he may not have noticed that his wife was making a name for herself with her folios they are to be seen at the british museum but one would be a mountebank in learning as she has it to pretend that one has read them now and then adventurous editors extract a slim volume and lured on by lambs praises a few people in every generation will take them off the shelves the duchess had what is called an active mind it was a dangerous possession if you were a woman and a duchess and lived in the time of charles the second it was not trained its gambols were received with explosions of flattery it could have the run of all the sciences if a clever duchess chanced to be vain into the bargain there was nothing to stop her ipse dixit the duke remarked will not serve my turn the duchess prided herself upon a still more perfect ignorance she had only seen descartes and hobbes not questioned them she did ask mr hobbes to dinner once but he would not come she knew no french though she had lived abroad five years she seldom listened to what was said to her in short her genius was her own if she found a spiders web she did her best to explain it her maid brought her a chrysalis and she pinched its tail ideas upon the destiny of mankind came over her in bed john she cried i conceive and a servant came running with a pen she was like a child picking a watch to pieces sir thomas browne had the same kind of curiosity but she had the misfortune to live either too late or too soon in elizabeths time she might have been one of the select band of learned ladies who were taught greek if she were alive now we should turn her energy on to a thousand committees our ancestors were wittier but more cruel than we are the society of the restoration was as intolerant of eccentricity as the society of boys at a public school the duchess with her folio volumes her odd manner of dress and behaviour was a laughing stock in london they called her that fool madge newcastle the children ran after her coach so that mr pepys puffing behind them could only see that it was painted silver where it is usually painted gold as i was getting out of my chair said count grammont i was stopped by the devil of a phantom in masquerade it is worth while to see her dress for she must have at least sixty ells of gauze and silver tissue about her not to mention a sort of pyramid upon her head adorned with a hundred thousand baubles i bet said the king that it is the duchess of newcastle thus baited the duchess withdrew to contemplate alone in the gardens at welbeck she was still full of ideas but there was no one to listen to her the duke was teaching a horse to dance or at work on a play of his own if there had been any kind of discussion a literary society such as we have now in the provinces something might have come of her ideas some practical woman might have educated her daughter the best bred women she said are those whose minds are civilest women live like bats or owls labour like beasts and die like worms again it is better to be an atheist than a superstitious man hunting she declared was a cruel sport but what did it matter if she thought sanely or chattered about the affections of the loadstone nobody listened to her i shall not rashly go there again she declared commenting upon a scene no doubt a real one in which she had told certain wives that they were no better than they should be easily bored i hate your fools she dismissed dull guests by bragging of myself which so frightened them that they went calling her heartless and a pedant left alone she worked herself into a glow by telling over the praises of posterity all this being over the duke and duchess lie beneath their tomb in westminster abbey when we look upon them we think not of them but of ourselves and the mystery of the past tombs are milestones to show us how far we have travelled along the invisible way rachel according to mr gribble the manse and the rectory are under illusions about the stage innocent girls and innocent parents dream of a beautiful place in london where genius displays its treasures and virtue is adored possibly mr gribble who knows all about france and the stage is under illusions about england and the rectory however this may be it seems hard upon the world that clergymens daughters should have to be educated publicly they are responsible for the only fault we find with mr gribbles book the vices are made very plain the melancholy very dark it was borne in upon her at last indeed that she was a shadow pursuing shadows but the habit of the chase had hold of her and she could not desist la pauvre rachell that is the leitmotifx we can imagine a country clergymans daughter reading this exclaiming poor thing but im not a bit like that and going up to town as gay as ever leaving the rectory out of the question however how far is this fair to rachel was she so vicious and so melancholy what did her genius mean to her to make up ones mind about an actress is of course the most troublesome of tasks mr gribble is bold he talks of her stage life and her real life the real individual is only to be discovered after the curtain has fallen and the applause has ceased when the curtain fell it is clear that rachel was generally to be found reckless and demoralised she went off to supper and spent the night in dissipation she scattered rings about the table she used mussets swordstick to pick her teeth dipping her lace sleeves in the sauce she confided to the company that she could not remember a time when she was what the world calls innocent she drank punch from a spoon already sticky with soup with one supper for sample we can imagine the rest we can imagine grand dukes jumping on to the dinnertable to stare at her and empresses tossing diamonds on to the stage we can imagine queen victoria remarking to her ladyinwaiting such a nice modest girl and the great duke of wellington paying compliments in broken french we can take all this for granted but her acting can we imagine that upon her acting mr gribble has some interesting remarks to make an actress he says does not create she interprets and although interpretation affords scope for genius as well as talent it only leaves a little room for the expression of personality the personality asserts itself when the curtain falls here we have the secret of rachels sadness that was why she wept and cried it is because i have to live the life of others and not my own but what after all is ones own life why should we draw these distinctions between real life and stage life it is when we feel most that we live most and we cannot believe that rachel married to a real man bearing real children and adding up real butchers bills would have lived more truly than rachel imagining the passions of women who never existed we are taking it for granted with mr gribble that rachel had genius as but two or three actresses have ever had it but even so it is hard to decide about an actress did she mean more when she cried i have lived the life of others than a poet or a novelist would have meant in one sense of course she did i was thinking she said that time would soon carry away every trace of my talent and that nothing would remain of what had once been rachel but besides the transiency of great acting compared with other forms of art there is another reason for discontent we must believe a great deal that is not felt comes into the life there is a great deal of pose and bad art rachel was a jewess the daughter of a pedlar and an oldclothes woman as a child she jolted about france in the back of her fathers cart and sang at street corners with his trained eye for business he saw that there was money in her talent she was taught enough to learn her parts rinsing the carrots as she read but for a long time she never read a play through and when she was famous she could not answer her own invitations scarcely any one could be less trained or supported to stand the blaze of sudden and violent celebrity but that was her fate before she was twenty her career makes one think of a very ingenious debtor always finding means at the last moment to pay his creditors manners that served very tolerably in the faubourg st germain she acquired she coaxed a great lawyer to spell for her to those who liked virtue she pretended that she was modesty besieged she could persuade authors who gave her their books that what she liked best was a quiet hour with the classics then she had her supper parties and defined the state of her innocence was she real at such times or was she real when charlotte bronte saw her i had seen acting before but never anything like this never anything which astonished hope and hushed desire which outstripped impulse and paled conception which instead of merely irritating imagination with the thought of what might be done at the same time fevering the nerves because it was not done disclosed power like a deep swollen winter river thundering in cataract and bearing the soul like a leaf on the steep and steel sweep of its descent the truth seems to be that one does not stop acting or painting or writing just because one happens to be dining or driving in the park only trying to combine the two things often ends disastrously perhaps disaster is more common among actresses than among other artists because the body plays so large a part upon the stage at any rate rachels experiment ended in something like ruin if we consider that she died of exhaustion at the age of thirtyseven having kicked her body round the world secured no permanent happiness and outlived her success melancholy indeed she was but surely the seed of that melancholy lay in the thought not that she had been an actress leading an unreal life but that she might have been a greater actress leading a still more real life i have not been one quarter as great as i might have been i have talent but i might have had genius ah if only i had been brought up differently if i had had different friends around me if i had lived a better life what an artist i should have been in that case there surely is the true cry of sorrow her life was so hurried so mixed there was so much trash in it and such enormous ecstasy the novels of george gissing let any one who has spent his life in writing novels consider the day which has now arrived for george gissing the fruit of his life stands before us a row of red volumes if they were biographies histories books about books even or speculations upon money or the course of the world there would be no need for the peculiar shudder but they bear titles like these denzil quarrier born in exile new grub street places and people that have never existed save in one brain now cold they are only novels it seems that there is genuine cause for shuddering when ones work takes this form dead leaves cannot be more brittle or more worthless than things faintly imagined and that the fruit of ones life should be twelve volumes of dead leaves we have one moment of such panic before the novels of george gissing and then we rise again not in our time will they be found worthless an interesting letter to mr clodd was printed the other day in it gissing wrote by the bye pinker has suggested to me that he should try to get all my works into the hands of some one publisher i should like this but i have a doubt whether the time has come yet there is a curious blending of respect and contempt in the publishers minds towards me and i should like to see which sentiment will prevail if the contempt one must relinquish ambitions proved to be idle and so attain a certain tranquillity even if it be that of the workhouse i was always envious of workhouse folk they are the most independent of all respect has prevailed messrs sidgwick and jackson reprint the eight later works both well and cheaply one born in exile is to be bought upon railway bookstalls for sevenpence nevertheless it is his own word respect that seems to describe the attitude of the public towards him he is certainly not popular he is not really famous if we may guess at the destiny of this new edition we can imagine that it will find its way to houses where very few novels are kept ordinary cultivated people will buy them of course but also governesses who scarcely ever read mechanics working men who despise novels dons who place him high among writers of english prose professional men the daughters of farmers in the north we can imagine that he is the favourite novelist of a great many middleaged sceptical rather depressed men and women who when they read want thought and understanding of life as it is not wit or romance in saying this we are saying also that gissing does not appeal to a great multitude the phrase life as it is is always the phrase of people who try to see life honestly and find it hard and dreary other versions of life they reject they are not perhaps in the majority but they form a minority that is very respectable and perhaps increasing if this is at all true of his readers what shall we say of the writer himself there is a great difference between writing and reading and gissing was a born writer when a novelist has been dead for some years and his books are gathered together we want as far as possible to stand where he stood not to be moved by one character or one idea but to grasp his point of view his books are very sad that is the first thing that strikes the reader the ordinary excitement of guessing the end is scarcely to be indulged in conceive the most gloomy yet natural conclusion to every complexity and you are likely to be right he had as most novelists have one great theme it is the life of a man of fine character and intelligence who is absolutely penniless and is therefore the sport of all that is most sordid and brutal in modern life he earns perhaps a pound a week he has thrown up his job in an office because an editor has accepted one of his stories he marries a woman of some refinement they live in a couple of rooms somewhere off the tottenham court road in a short time they cannot pay the rent they move they sell pieces of furniture they live off tea and bread and butter then his books go all day long in spite of headache and sore throat in bitter fog and clinging mist the wretched man has to spin imaginary loves and imaginary jests from his exhausted brain he has the additional agony of loving good writing he can lose himself still in dreams of the acropolis or in argument about euripides his wife leaves him for the dirt repels her at last his stuff has become too poor even to sell and he dies knowing himself beaten on every hand many readers happily rebound from their depression when the end is reached exclaiming after all this is only one side there are quantities of people who have enough money to avoid these horrors a few who can command luxury but what gissing proves is the terrible importance of money and if you slip how you fall and fall and fall with learning sensitive feelings a love of beauty both in art and in human nature all the qualities that generally one hopes keep their possessor somehow afloat he descended to the depths where men and women live in vast shoals without light or freedom what a strange place it is this nether world there are women as brutal as savages men who are half animals women still preserving some ghost of love and pity men turning a stunted brain upon the problems of their lot all the things that grow fine and large up here are starved and twisted down there just as the squares and parks and the houses standing separate with rooms measured off for different occupations are shrivelled into black alleys sooty patches of green and sordid lodging houses where there is shelter but only the shelter that pigs or cows have not room for the soul without money you cannot have space or leisure worse than that the chances are very much against your having either love or intelligence many writers before and after gissing have written with both knowledge and sympathy of the poor what after all is more stimulating to the imagination than the sight of great poverty or great wealth there was mrs gaskell for instance and dickens a score of writers in our own day have studied the conditions of their lives but the impressive part about gissing is that knowing them as he did he makes no secret of the fact that he hated them that is the reason why his voice is so harsh so penetrating so little grateful to the ears can any one hate poverty with all their soul who does not hate the poor some great and noble sorrow he writes may have the effect of drawing hearts together but to struggle against destitution to be crushed by care about shillings and sixpences that must always degrade there is no sentimentalism about the fundamental equality of men in his works adela mutimer in demos gazing at her husbands face opposite her ponders thus gissing must often have thought the same it was the face of a man by birth and breeding altogether beneath her never had she understood that as now never had she conceived so forcibly the reason which made him and her husband and wife only in name suppose that apparent sleep of his to be the sleep of death he would pass from her consciousness like a shadow from the field leaving no trace behind their life of union was a mockery their married intimacy was an unnatural horror he was not of her class not of her world only by violent wrenching of the laws of nature had they come together she had spent years in trying to convince herself that there were no such distinctions that only an unworthy prejudice parted class from class one moment of true insight was worth more than all her theorising on abstract principles to be her equal this man must be born again of other parents in other conditions of life she had no claims to aristocratic descent but her parents were gentlefolk that is to say they were both born in a position which encouraged personal refinement rather than the contrary which expected of them a certain education in excess of lifes barest need which authorised them to use the service of ruder men and women in order to secure to themselves a margin of life for lifes sake perhaps for three generations her ancestors could claim so much gentility it was more than enough to put a vast gulf between her and the mutimers favourable circumstances of upbringing had endowed her with delicacy of heart and mind not inferior to that of any woman living mated with an equal husband the children born of her might hope to take their place among the most beautiful and the most intelligent and her husband was a man incapable of understanding her idlest thought it would have been so much easier to lessen the gulf so much more graceful to waive the advantages of three generations of gentle birth but to have the vices of the poor is the way to incite the best kind of pity the measure of his bitterness is the measure of his love of good but there is nothing surprising in the fact that gissing was never popular however harsh and censorious people are in their daily actions they do it unofficially as it were they shrink from any statement of the creed that makes them act thus in fiction particularly which is a relaxation like golf they detest anything severe it is part of their enjoyment to see others looking rosy and thus to feel somewhat rosier themselves gissing had no sympathy whatever with this common weakness no no he makes biffen say in new grub street let us copy life when the man and woman are to meet for the great scene of passion let it all be frustrated by one or other of them having a bad cold in the head and so on let the pretty girl get a disfiguring pimple on her nose just before the ball at which she is going to shine show the numberless repulsive features of common decent life seriously coldly not a hint of facetiousness or the thing becomes different the novel that biffen wrote on these lines is of course a failure and eventually he takes his own life upon putney heath the reader then whose pleasure it is to identify himself with the hero or heroine and to feel in some strange way that he shares their virtues is completely baffled his natural instinct is to find fault with the cynicism of the writer but gissing is no cynic the real cynics are the writers who have a trivial merry view of life and make people easily content and drugged with cheap happiness what good gissing finds in human beings is absolutely genuine for it has stood such tests and the pleasures he allows them the pleasures of reading companionship and a few comfortable evenings glow with a warmth as of redhot coals his work has another quality that does not make for popularity either his men and women think when we seek the cause of his gloom is it not most truly to be found there each of the people who from one cause or another has to suffer the worst bruises in the nether world is a thinking creature capable not only of feeling but of making that feeling part of a view of life it is not gone when the pain is over but persists in the form of melancholy questionings what is to be said for a world in which there is so much suffering by itself this peculiarity is enough to distinguish gissings characters from those of other novelists there are characters who feel violently characters who are true types witty characters bad ones good ones eccentric ones buffoons but the thinking man has seldom had justice done to him the great advantage of making people think is that you can describe other relationships besides the great one between the lover and the beloved there is friendship for instance the relationship that is founded on liking the same books or sharing the same enthusiasms there is a relationship between one man and men in general all these it seems to us gissing has described with extraordinary fineness it is out of these relationships that he makes the texture of his works loves have exploded tragedies have fired up and sunk to ashes these quiet undemonstrative feelings between one man and another one woman and another persist they spin some kind of thread across the ravages they are the noblest things he has found in the world naturally gissing practised what is generally called the english method of writing fiction instead of leaping from one high pinnacle of emotion to the next he filled in all the adjoining parts most carefully it is sometimes very dull the general effect is very low in tone you have to read from the first page to the last to get the full benefit of his art but if you read steadily the low almost insignificant chapters gather weight and impetus they accumulate upon the imagination they are building up a world from which there seems to be no escape violence would have the effect of an escape but thus it comes about that it is difficult to point to any scene or passage and demand admiration do we even single out one character among all his men and women to be remembered he has no jane eyres no uncle tobys but here is a passage that is characteristic of his terse workmanlike prose glowing at the heart with a kind of flameless fire manor park cemetery lies in the remote east end and gives sleeping places to the inhabitants of a vast district the regions around were then being built upon for the first time the familiar streets of pale damp brick were stretching here and there continuing london much like the spreading of a disease epping forest is near at hand and nearer the dreary expanse of wanstead flats not grief but chill desolation makes this cemetery its abode a country churchyard touches the tenderest memories and softens the heart with longing for the eternal rest the cemeteries of wealthy london abound in dear and great associations or at worst preach homilies which connect themselves with human dignity and pride here on the waste limits of that dread east to wander among tombs is to go hand in hand with the stark and eyeless emblem of mortality the spirit fails beneath the cold burden of ignoble destiny here lie those who were born for toil who when toil has worn them to the uttermost have but to yield their useless breath and pass into oblivion for them is no day only the brief twilight of a winter sky between the former and the latter night for them no aspiration for them no hope of memory in the dust their very children are wearied into forgetfulness indistinguishable units in the vast throng that labours but to support life the name of each father mother child is as a dumb cry for the warmth and love of which fate so stinted them the wind wails above their narrow tenements the sandy soil soaking in the rain as soon as it has fallen is a symbol of the great world which absorbs their toil and straightway blots their being we are in the habit of throwing faults upon the public as though it were a general rubbish heap for it cannot bring an action for libel but to be unpopular is a sign that there is something wrong or how have the classics come to be the classics gissings public we believe to be a very good public but it leaves out much that is good in the great public the reason is that he wrote his best only when he was describing struggles and miseries and noble sufferings like those we have dwelt upon above directly he dealt with men and women living at ease he lost his grip he did not see directly he changed his sober prosaic prose for a loftier style he was without merit he had a world of his own as real as hard as convincing as though it were made of earth and stone nay far more so but it was a small world there is no such place as the world no such life as life as it is we need only consider the result of reading too much gissing we want another world we take down evan harrington which is true that misery or this magnificence they are both true everything is true that can make us believe it to be true beauty beyond all other beauty horror beyond all other horror still lie hidden about us waiting for some one to see them the thing that really matters that makes a writer a true writer and his work permanent is that he should really see then we believe then there arise those passionate feelings that true books inspire is it possible to mistake books that have this life for books without it hard though it is to explain where the difference lies two figures suggest themselves in default of reasons you clasp a bird in your hands it is so frightened that it lies perfectly still yet somehow it is a living body there is a heart in it and the breast is warm you feel a fish on your line the line hangs straight as before down into the sea but there is a strain on it it thrills and quivers that is something like the feeling which live books give and dead ones cannot give they strain and quiver but satisfactory works of art have a quality that is no less important it is that they are complete a good novelist it seems goes about the world seeing squares and circles where the ordinary person sees mere stormdrift the wildest extravagance of life in the moon can be complete or the most shattered fragment when a book has this quality it seems unsinkable here is a little world for us to walk in with all that a human being needs gissings novels seem to us to possess both these essential qualities life and completeness and for these reasons we cannot imagine that they will perish there will always be one or two people to exclaim this man understood
