this part of virginia woolfs diary is a kind of prelude to the main work after almost six weeks of conscientious reporting the diary ends why she began this record we do not know but we do know why she stopped from the middle of february she plunged into madness this was the second phase of her longest breakdown an aggressive and violent period very different from the melancholic and suicidal mania which had preceded it in the latter half of this prelude therefore describes the end of a fair interval between two fearful tempests of lunacy virginias first novel the voyage out had been accepted in march its publication was delayed until march she only mentions it once but it would not be wise to suppose that it was absent from her thoughts the knowledge that it was so soon to appear may well have been the cause of her renewed insanity this is diary i see appendix each entry is dated on a small oval lozengeshaped or circular label gummed to the top of the page the first eleven dates are typewritten friday january to start this diary rightly it should begin on the last day of the old year when at breakfast i received a letter from mrs hallett she said that she had had to dismiss lily at a moments notice owing to her misbehaviour we naturally supposed that a certain kind of misbehaviour was meant a married gardener i hazarded our speculations made us both uncomfortable all day now this morning i hear from lily herself she writes very calmly that she left because mrs hallett was insulting to her having been given a day nights holiday she came back at am not early enough what is the truth this i guess mrs h is an old angry woman meticulous indeed as we knew tyrannical about her servants lily honestly meant no wrong but i have written for particulars another lady wanting a character at once then i had to write to mrs waterlow about the chimney sweeping charges foisted on us such a letter as comes naturally to the strong character but not to the weak and then we tramped to the coops in rain cold to protest against their bookkeeping manager a bored languid young man repeating rather than defending himself halfway home we heard british warship british warship found that the formidable has been sunk in the channel we were kept awake last night by new year bells at first i thought they were ringing for a victory saturday january this is the kind of day which if it were possible to choose an altogether average sample of our life i should select we breakfast i interview mrs le grys she complains ofthe huge belgian appetites their preference for food fried in butter they never give one anything she remarked the count taking xmas dinner with them insisted after pork turkey that he wanted a third meat therefore mrs le g hopes that the war will soon be over if they eat thus in their exile how must they eat at home she wonders after this l i both settle down to our scribbling he finishes his folk story review i do about pages of poor effies story we lunch read the papers agree that there is no news i read guy mannering upstairs for minutes then we take max a dog for a walk halfway up to the bridge we found ourselves cut off by the river which rose visibly with a little ebb flow like the pulse of a heart indeed the road we had come along was crossed after minutes by a stream several inches deep one of the queer things about the suburbs is that the vilest little red villas are always let that not one of them has an open window or an uncurtained window i expect that people take a pride in their curtains there is great rivalry among neighbours one house had curtains of yellow silk striped with lace insertion the rooms inside must be in semidarkness i suppose rank with the smell of meat human beings i believe that being curtained is a mark of respectability sophie used to insist upon it and then i did my marketing saturday night is the great buying night some counters are besieged by three rows of women i always choose the empty shops where i suppose one pays jd a lb more and then we had tea honey cream now l is typewriting his article we shall read all the evening go to bed it is strange how old traditions so long buried as cone thinks suddenly crop up again at hyde park gate we used to set apart sunday morning for cleaning the silver table here i find myself keeping sunday morning for odd jobstypewriting it was today tidying the room doing accounts which are very complicated this week i have little bags of coppers which each owe the other something we went to a concert at the queens hall in the afternoon considering that my ears have been pure of music for some weeks i think patriotism is a base emotion by this i mean i am writing in haste expecting flora to dinner that they played a national anthem a hymn all i could feel was the entire absence of emotion in myself everyone else if the british spoke openly about wcs copulation then they might be stirred by universal emotions as it is an appeal to feel together is hopelessly muddled by intervening greatcoats fur coats i begin to loathe my kind principally from looking at their faces in the tube really raw red beef silver herrings give me more pleasure to look upon but then i was kept standing minutes at charing x station so got home late missed duncan who came here moreover london on a sunday night now with all its electric globes half muffled in blue paint is the most dismal of places there are long mud coloured streets just enough daylight insufficient electric light to see the naked sky which is inexpressibly cold flat the times today has an article upon the stars of londonwe may gain from them a serviceable impulse to that steady concentration on enduring issues of which stars are a true symbol k the glare of london is not so be it th jan monday january i do not like the jewish voice i do not like the jewish laugh otherwise i think in saxons phrase there is something to be said for flora woolf she can typewrite do shorthand sing play chess write stories which are sometimes accepted she earns a week as the secretary of the principal ofthe scottish church in london and in doing these various arts she will keep lively till a great old age like a man playing with five billiard balls the outside world burst in upon us with a clamour this morning i had a letter from mrs hallett had a letter from lily l had a document from sydney waterlow according to mrs hallett lily hid a soldier in the butlers pantry she also met soldiers at the gates thus mrs halletts house got a bad name in the village besides which mrs hallett herself was alarmed there being ladies only in the house lily confesses merely to one brother but adds that mrs h is very ill as well as very old as for sydneys letteri am so sick of it that i cant describe it the house was dirty people scrubbing for a fortnight only succeeded in making it tolerable so so onall of which would have been suffered in silence but for my note so i wrote to him i wrote to lily after spending some time in phrasing virtuous sentiments nobly i see clearly how official skins grow thick shiny to lily i said that she must promise to behave better if i gave her another characterfor i am sure poor mrs hallett her trembling old sister heard soldier voices whenever there was a wind in the laurels philip came after luncheon having days leave he is sick to death of soldieringtold us tales of military stupidity which pass belief they found a man guilty of desertion the other day k sentenced him k then discovered that the man did not exist the colonel says i like well dressed young mengentlemen k gets rid of recruits who sink below this level in addition to this the demand for cavalry at the front is exhausted so that probably they will stay at colchester for ever another dark rainy day an aeroplane passed overhead tuesday january i had a letter this morning from nessa who calls mrs waterlow a german hausfrau k advises us not to pay a penny cleanliness is a fetish not to be worshipped she says certainly neither of us do worship it i suppose mrs w ran about with a duster k dabbed her finger under beds i can imagine the list of discoveries she gave sydney sitting smoking over his philosophy k how she cursed that dreadful slut virginia woolf at the same time it is a point of honour among servants to find the house they go into filthy k to leave it bright as a pin but enough of waterlows k their slop pails we worked as usual as usual it rained after lunch we took the air in the old deer park k marked by a line of straw how high the river had been k how a great tree had fallen across the towing path crushing the railing beneath it three bodies were seen yesterday swiftly coursing downstream at teddington does the weather prompt suicide the times has a queer article upon a railway smash in which it says that the war has taught us a proper sense of proportion with respect to human life i have always thought we priced it absurdly high but i never thought the times would say so l went off to hampstead to give the first ofhis lectures to the womens guild he did not seem nervous he is speaking at this moment we rather think that old mr davies is dyingbut i have an idea hell resist for years to come although he wants to die his life prevents margaret from much work i bought my fish meat in the high streeta degrading but rather amusing business i dislike the sight of women shopping they take it so seriously then i got a ticket in the library k saw all the shabby clerks dressmakers thumbing illustrated papers like very battered bees on very battered flowers at least they are warm dry it rains again today the belgians downstairs are playing cards with some friends talk talktalkwhile their country is destroyed after all they have nothing else to do wednesday january the waterlows again lily again mrs w writes to leonard this time about the oven ends by being very much distressed to think we are annoyedseeing how delightful they find asheham it is a queer thing that both the ladies in this correspondence write to both the gentlemenfeeling instinctively i believe that if they wrote to each other the whole affair would become much more acid lilys letter continues the story of the hidden soldier it brings her very clearly before me with her charming stupid doglike eyes quite incapable of hurting a fly or thinking a coarse thought yet bound eternally to suffer for the sins of stronger characters in this case she was at the mercy of a parlourmaid who invited the soldiers lily had neither the strength of mind to be rude to them when they came nor to tell tales of a fellow servant i would rather do anything than that that i imagine was how she had her baby too anyhow i have spoken for her again she has promised to have no more to do with soldiers l went off at io am to give his second lecture at hampstead the first was a great success as i knew it would be he finds the women much more intelligent than the men in some ways too intelligent apt on that account not to see the real point he has another to give this afternoon so he is staying up at hampstead lunching with lilian perhaps seeing janet no one except a very modest person would treat these working women lilian janet margaret as he does clive or indeed any other clever young man would give himself airs however much he admired them pretend that he didnt i wrote all the morning with infinite pleasure which is queer because i know all the time that there is no reason to be pleased with what i write that in weeks or even days i shall hate it then i went to london asked at grays inn about chambers they had a set vacant i at once envisaged all sorts of charms let myself into them with a thrill of excitement but they would be perfect for one impossible for two there are perfect rooms looking over the gardens that is about all grays inn road thunders behind one next i saw a flat in bedford row which promised divinely but on asking at the agents was told they had just been instructed to let it furnished only and now of course i am convinced that there is no flat in london to equal it i could wander about the dusky streets in holborn bloomsbury for hours the things one sees guesses atthe tumult riot busyness of it all crowded streets are the only places too that ever make me whatinthecase of anotheronemightcall think now i have to decide whether i shall go up again to a party at gordon sqre where the aranyis are playing on the one hand i shirk the dressing the journey on the other i know that with the first chink of light in the hall chatter of voices i should become intoxicated determine that life held nothing comparable to a party i should see beautiful people get a sensation of being on the highest crest of the biggest waveright in the centre swim of things on the third final hand the evenings reading by the fire herereading michelet the idiot smoking talking to l in what stands for slippers dressing gownare heavenly too and as he wont urge me to go i know very well that i shant besides there is vanity i have no clothes to go in thursday y january nowe didnt go to the gordon sqre party leonard got back too late it rained k really we didnt want to go the lectures were a great success one old lady told leonard that they should consider him a personal friend for life another said that he was the only gentleman who spoke so that working women could understand he explained bills of exchange so on for an hour k then answered questions which again were amazingly intelligent i started off after lunch today first to go to the foundling hospital k ask whether they would let us have brunswick squareor half the house then to the omega to buy janet a shawl k then to tea with janet mr chubb opened the door to me at the hospital he was sitting at a writing table in a very warm comfortable room looking on to the garden while a clerk drew plans of houses on a very high desk mr chubb is growing fat he recognised me k became immediately extremely courteous brunswick sqre is already practically let to a retired ceylon civil servant called spence who may however be willing to let the two upper floors which would suit us very well i became of course possessed with a passion to have brunswick square mr chubb who has infinite leisure k likes conversation discussed every possibility he did not himself admire adrians frescoes but said that most people do the ceylon gentleman proposed to cover them with a curtain being apparently of opinion that they were too good to destroy though not nice to look upon he is a bachelor perhaps rather a crusty bachelor once chief of the colombo lunatic asylum at this point a secretary came in also excessively polite when he heard my name mrs woolf certainly has a very strong claim to the house he said and i myself dont think spence is quite right i do mr chubb replied firmly ive looked him up in the medical directorybesides he seems all right he looks all right certainly the secretary agreed but i dont know however it wouldnt be playing the game to refuse at the eleventh hour the twelfth you may say said mr chubb at last i left shaking hands all round k having begged mr chubb to do his best k let us know they advised me to see a house in mecklenburgh sqre which i did it is a vast place with a great hall a sweeping staircase k we could have a flat at the topthe only objection being that grays inn road is at the back when i got out it was raining i walked to the omega however k bought my stuff from a foolish young woman in a post impressionist tunic i went to hampstead found some elderly lady there already went to the station in order to avoid tea with emphie k then was allowed up to janet she is in bed k will have to stay in bed for weeks her nerves are thoroughly wrong she cant read or do anythingi can guess what she feels likek how miserable she must be very oftenespecially since she is growing old k emphie must be wearisome with her repetitions k general enthusiastic vagueness k then the fag end of life still she is trained to be brave k so unselfish by nature that other people really interest her we talked about leonard k lily k life in london k hardys poems which she cant reread too melancholy k sordidk the subjects not interesting enough i dont agree it grew late k she suggested that i should dine there k go with l to the peace debate at the womens guild i couldnt face dinner so i retreated to the public library on the way i walked through one of the worst downpours i have ever been in it was more like a shower bath than natural rain my shoes squeaked so with wet as i walked up the library that i was ashamed then i dined at a cabmans eating housethe only dining place k very good coarse but clean k sober at i met l at church row the rooms are old white pannelled rooms one was full of working women it was a comfort after reading more terrific letters of childbirth to see how the women roar with laughter like schoolgirls mr hobson spoke it was very good the women impressive as usualbecause they seem to feel to have such a sense of responsibility another letter from mrs waterlow friday january sydney waterlow came to lunch with us today to make sure as he put it that we had not quarrelled over these wretched matters we discussed little else for the first hour a half my first letter had given him a sleepless night he told us though mrs waterlow in spite of pregnancy slept sound as far as we could make out mrs w acts writes impulsively when sydney bestirred himself to think he was appalled to realise that their behaviour was not ethically sound he cogitated for long devoted a whole morning to his reply has taken the advice of several friends who happen to agree with him that chimneys are usually swept by landlords but then we should have asked your leavei entirely yield that point only so on so on all in the solid simple style which is so like him his fat pink body always seems to me boneless hairless like that of a gigantic child his mind is the same but there is a charm about him he l went for a walk i went to chancellors to ask whether there was any news of hogarth at first the man said no when i told him that we might take a house in london he at once confessed that he had twice seen mrs wontner the present tenant that she does not like the house is this invented if not is there some good reason why she does not like it it seems likely that we shall have to choose between brunswick hogarthunless both fail us sydney came back to tea told us how alice had been to see them how he had at once regretted her as one might regret a very fine walkingstick she was so pretty happy with a great fat baby the house was full of our furniturelike a house of death to me but when i suggested that the present mrs w had been uncomfortable he was amazed she isnt that sort of person at all he said shes perfectly sensible still if she saw sydney coveting the walking stick i thought sydney replied that marg as he calls her was so infinitely more to him than the walking stick that she couldnt feel anything of the kind he went off to asheham they want to take it on for another months he has no work to do but asheham is so delightful that he is perfectly happy doing nothing saturday january at two oclock this morning several barges moored in the river broke loose one crashed into richmond bridge knocked off a good deal of stone from one ofthe arches the others went to the bottom or drifted down stream all this i mention not because we saw or heard anything of it but because we noticed the damaged bridge as we walked to kingston this afternoon the stone is yellower inside than out which makes it more obvious we had a very good walk the purplish fields outside kingston somehow reminded me of saragossa there is a foreign look about a town which stands up against the sunset is approached by a much trodden footpath across a field i wonder why one instinctively feels that one is complimenting kingston absurdly in saying that it is like a foreign town on the towpath we met had to pass a long line of imbeciles the first was a very tall young man just queer enough to look twice at but no more the second shuffled k looked aside then one realised that every one in that long line was a miserable ineffective shuffling idiotic creature with no forehead or no chin an imbecile grin or a wild suspicious stare it was perfectly horrible they should certainly be killed we found a market going on at kingston as if it were marlborough we bought a pineapple for d the man said they had all ripened on his hands as he expected another boatload on tuesday he had to sell at a loss we had a bad tea in a very pretentious place we came back by train with a working man k two small boys the working man began to tell us about the lyons meat contract scandals k told us that he was attached to the flying department at hounslow he was very clever k should have been an mp or a journalist at least i see will vaughan quoted in the times to the effect that teachers neglect the grammar of modern languages k talk too much about style k literature but nothing fortifies the character k mind so much as grammar how like him sunday io january i was sitting typewriting this morning when there came a tap at the door someone whom i thought at first was adrian appeared it was walter lamb however fresh from the king whenever he has seen the king he comes to tell us he insisted that we should go for a walk with him in richmond park what did we talk about we forgot about the king walter told us a long inexpressibly dreary story which professor houseman had told him about the inefficiency of the french soldiers i whatever walter says has the same flat smooth grey surface his voice alone would dull the fieriest poesy in the world nor does he deal in i fiery poems his life now lies among respectable semismart rich people whom he half despises so that his accounts are always a little condescending the one passion of his life is for eighteenth century building all the time this morning he was bidding us admire a moulding or a window frame or even a fan light he sees over any house that is to let apparently notices the internal decorations he knows who now lives in big houses who once lived in them he is perfectly suited by kew the royal academy the royal family on our doorstep he burst at length into an account of the last royal visit when the king who now treats him as a friend or rather as leonard say like a superior footman suddenly stopped admiring the pictures k asked princess victoria where she gets her false teeth mine george exclaimed are always dropping into my plate theyll be down my throat next my man is a rascal im going to leave him victoria then gave a tug to her front teeth told him that they were as sound as could beperfectly white useful the king then went back to the pictures his style of talk reminds me of george rd in fanny burneys diaryk so one must bless walter for something he refused to lunch with us saying that he had lived on pheasants all the week k rhubarb was forbidden him on account of his acidity it rains hard all the afternoon k now marjorie strachey who was to dine with us cant come because of a cold i heard last night from mr chubb that old spence wont let any part of brunswick square monday january leonard was in his bath this morning k i was lying in bed wondering whether i should stretch out my hand for rob roy when i heard a commotion next door k then someone rushed downstairs crying in a strange unnatural voice fire fire as it was obvious that the house was not on fire to any large extent i put on my waterproof k slippers before i looked out of the window i then smelt paper burning i then went into the passage k found smoke pouring from the open door of the next room there was clearly time to escape so i withdrew k heard lizzy return with the lodger k heard her begin i only put a bit of paper to draw the fire from which i guessed what had happened in ten minutes the room would have been ablaze said the lodger l came back k we looked out of our window k saw a large japanese screen all in flames burning on the grass plot later i heard that the paper had caught the draperies on the mantelpiece had caught the screen had caught the woodwork had caught as every room in the house is lined with dry old wood loosely papered over io minutes i think would have put the fire beyond water jugs the lodger was in terror too for his priceless rugs worth hundreds k hundreds according to mrs le grys the wonder is how we have escaped so far considering lizzy yesterday she smashed two very nice bits of china for us we went up to london this afternoon l to see the editor of the new statesman about an article on diplomacyi to go over a flat in mecklenburgh square we met unexpectedly in m sqre when we reached the house however the occupier refused to let us see it so we had to apply to the owner who lives a few doors off we were shown into a beautiful room which was disfigured horribly with velvet curtains gigantic purple cushions k the usual swarm of gilt k lemon coloured objects the woman herself sat in an invalid chair arranged like a childs high chair with a bar across it her hair a flaxen wig was plastered on either side of her head k she had the usual powdered plump rouged look of bloomsbury ladies this always makes us both physically uncomfortable she was very sensible however a business woman i suppose owning several houses running them im sure at a profit she made us see over her house instead of the other one we were taken over by a small wizened very amiable old lady who had disfigured her part of the house until it was scarcely recognisable the drawing room in particular where she had lavished her skill made your eyes start with its innumerable discordant hideous small thingstwo clusters of flags displayed on the tables chiefly impressed me there were all the flags of all the nations i should think all the photographs of all the royal families it was like looking into a kaleidoscope because of the innumerable separate dots of colour yet they werent colour i went on to days library k l to the london library he has to write an article of words by wednesday noon on diplomatists a wonderful subject anyhow tuesday iz january today did not begin with a fire leonard however had to take mrs le grys to task for lizzies sins the poor woman could only agree since she knows she is going she doesnt mind how many plates she breaks if she would only go mrs le g finds it impossible to get a servant she pays them only a year however cecil came to luncheon in mufti i observed in fact they are both entirely sick of the army see no chance of going to the front nevertheless cecil thinks of being a permanent soldier because the life is better than a barristers life on the other hand he philip may go to the colonies the odd thing about the woolf family to me is the extreme laxness of it in my family the discussions agitations that went on about the slightest change in ones way of life were endless but with the ws it doesnt much seem to matter whether they turn farmer run away with another mans wife or marry a polish jew tailors daughter i remember how elaborately aunt mary concealed the fact that herveys young woman was a kind of shopkeeper how indefatigable she was until the engagement was broken off perhaps the ws havent a family tradition it gives a sense of freedom anyhow from all this obviously i have nothing to say l k cecil walked to kingston after lunch i pottered about buying small fragments of meat vegetables got some books out of the library i believe we shall find it more useful than the london library as no one save ourselves reads solid books l is now writing his article upon diplomacy i must go typewrite an entire fine day for a wonder wednesday january i caused some slight argument with l this morning by trying to cook my breakfast in bed i believe however that the good sense of the proceeding will make it prevail that is if i can dispose of the eggshells l went off to the new statesman office this morning with his article i lunched here then went to days to get more books days at in the afternoon is the haunt of fashionable ladies who want to be told what to read a more despicable set of creatures i never saw they come in furred like seals k scented like civets condescend to pull a few novels about on the counter k then demand languidly whether there is anything amusing the days assistants are the humblest k most servile of men they tow these aged countesses k pert young millionairesses about behind them always deferential k profuse of ladyships the west end of london fills me with aversion i look into motor cars k see the fat grandees inside like portly jewels in satin cases the afternoons now have an elongated pallid look as if it were neither winter nor spring i came back to tea l arrivedhaving seen gordon sqre k maynard who says german finance is crumbling k saxon who is recovering from influenza he had a headache so instead of going to the coop meeting we are staying at home thursday january we were woken this morning i see this is going to become a stock phrase like once upon a time in a faery story by a thumping throbbing sound as if a motor omnibus were on the roof endeavouring to start experience told now however that lizzy had merely made a huge kitchen fire when there was no water in the pipes when l turned on the tap steam issued as if it were siegfrieds dragon at covent garden k then came floating bits of pipe k the water was rust red nobody however seemed to think that the boiler might burst we wrote all the morning i heard from adrian by the way who has gone into rooms in cambridge without a single sheet now i begin telephoning writing about sheets just as the waterlows are silent after lunch we set off to kingston in order to buy some charming cups which are to be had there for id each if lizzie doesnt go continues to behave as though each day were her last we must give her something cheap to break her rage against we came home on the top of a bus making up phrases in the manner tone of walter lamb leonard is going up to hear the fabians discourse i think i shall indulge in a picture palacebut why i shall certainly come out saying to myself nothing will induce me ever to go to a picture palace again i also heard from annie who evidently intends to be our permanent cook for the excellent reason i think that ours is the easiest place in england the waterlows say that her young man has removed toor been replaced by oneat willesden ls article on diplomacy is to come out on saturday he was of course convinced after sending it that it would be rejected this is a note for future use quotation friday i january i went to my picture palace l to his fabians he thought on the whole that his mind spirit body would have profited more by the pictures than by the webbs the doctors who were talking about their etiquette there were or superb pictures one of a barge laden with timber floating past bagdadanother of an eastern palace overrun with apes pariah dogsanother of a sunken yatcht but as usual the drama is very boring iwish one liked what everyone likes the hall was crowded roars of laughter applause c i heard from emphie case this morning who wishes me to find out about the home at lewes where lily had her childas she knows a young woman who also wants to have a child i wonder how emphie comes across these things janet much the same we walked to hogarth this afternoon to see if the noise of schoolchildren is really a drawback apparently it would only affect suffield welli wonder what we shall do id give a lot to turn over pages or so find written down what happens to us we walked into the park saw territorials flogging spurring their carthorses also a great fallen tree we are dining early going to a hallan unheard of dissipation though there was a time when i went out to operas evenings concerts c at least times a week and i know we shall both feel when its over really a good read would have been better l continues to read diplomatists i read about the kemblestennyson so on to get the spirit of that time for the sake of the third generation they were immensely scientificalways digging up extinct monsters looking at the stars trying to find a religion at this moment i feel as if the human race had no character at allsought for nothing believed in nothing fought only from a dreary sense of duty i began today to treat my corn it had to be done for a week saturday january i think the hall coliseum last night was worth whilein spite of draw backswhat i like in halls are turnscomic singers or men imitating prima donnas or jugglers i dont like one act plays it takes me a whole act to get into a play so one act plays are mostly sheer boredom therefore i was disappointed to have one act plays one the barrie der tagsheer balderdash of the thinnest kind about the german emperor then a play about a woman who means parrot when she says pirate third dr johnson to begin with johnson spits bread butter through his nose to end with he is paternal sentimental as tender as a womanwhich is of course what he was bound to be on the stage however there was a man who sang like a prima donna a patriotic revuepeople clapped grey more than anyone we left just as an eastern jar coloured grey violet shot up in the middle of the stage i didnt see my war pictures but departed mildly as a lamb we wrote this morning ls article by the way reads very well in the new statesman i had a request from adrian for silver glass kitchen things they seem to have set up house without a single article he wrote by a candle light stuck in a saucer l went to the l library i took max along the river but we were a good deal impeded by a bone he stole by my suspenders coming down by a dogfight in which his ear was torn bled horribly i thought how happy i was without any ofthe excitements which once seemed to me to constitute happiness l i argued for some time about this also about the worthlessness of all human works except as a means of keeping the workers happymy writing now delights me solely because i love writing dont honestly care a hang what anyone says j what seas of horror one dives through in order to pick up these pearlshowever they are worth it sunday january the morning was unremarkablein the afternoon herbert came k took l for a walk i went to a queens hall concert stayed for three beautiful tunes came back to find herbert who stayed on till dinnertime marjorie strachey came to dinner changed somehow at the first glance improved i thought though noticeably thinner she complained of sleeplessness in the usual s way of being shattered life being too fearful but she talked of ordinary things until after dinner she began to harp very markedly on marriagei should say that for no reason at all she said to us ive a friend who thinks me rather beautiful very stupid half suspecting something odd i said o hes a working man you mustnt marry him well she pressed us more k more with questions about married life whether she should marry how she wanted to marry sometimes i thought she was only talking as so many unmarried people do sometimes i suspected there was more at last one of us i perhaps said well but marjorie what dyou want to be a married woman she answered tragically but is there someone you want to marry yes does he want to marry you yeswho is he she buried her face in her hands then exclaimed a married man jos wedgwood we both gasped in silence and then we discussed nothing else for an hour or two it is about the oddest business i ever heard ofthis being more or less what has happened last summer jos left his wife or she left him this point being doubtful since that he has lived alone in london k complained bitterly to philip morrell among others of his loneliness philip recommended a prostitute ottoline thereupon procured marjorie they asked her to dinner k after dinner ottoline danced behind the folding doors k left marjorie to a tremendous tete a tete with jos although this was their first meeting he told her his history k his sorrows next day he called on lady strachey they met constantly k a week or so before xmas he proposed to her at lockeridge by this time she was much in love k accepted himbut what are they to do she refuses to let him get a divorce on the ground that a divorce is ignominious he moreover says that a divorce would ruin him politically he is tremendously ambitious she wishes to live with him as his wife but this of course means utter political ruin again to be an ordinary mistress is out of the question for her lady strachey again complicates the question because she would be horrified at any unconventionality k cannot be told of it then there is the fear of mrs wedgwood if she hears will she try to get jos back will she succeed half of the stracheys lytton among them advise m to think no more of it she is obviously in love k also quite distracted k worn out she is going to the south of france jos meanwhile is going to the front well what can one make of it all seeing m in love k her love returned i felt that the only course was the extreme one but when i reflected particu larly upon the way in which the thing has happened the shortness of it ottolines manoeuvres i had doubtsabout jos mostly isnt it a case of sydney waterlow over again will his feeling last even if hers does he was married for years to ethel they have children leonard is pessimistic right i expect he thinks that m is going the worst way for her own prospects points out the horror of her position as a mistress without any tie upon a man who admittedly cares more for his career than anything has been supplied with her to gratify wants which may quickly pass but for some time now they will be apart so things may settle themselves for her i feel it is the great affair of her life one way or the other this morning obeying a nocturnal command i wrote to thomas hardy thanking him for his poem about father his works monday january we were still a good deal under the influence of marjorie this morning all night it seemed people were banging boxes next door the lodger has got a wife back from new york this afternoon we went over the houses in mecklenburgh sqre which has led to a long discussion about our future a fresh computation of income the future is dark which is ton the whole the best thing the future can be i think l went to the webbs i came homenor has anything happened since to be worth putting down save that as i began this page l stated that he had determined to resign his commission to write a pamphlet about arbitration now i shall stop this diary discuss that piece of folly with him it is partly due to my egoistical habit of always talking the argument of my book i want to see what can be said against all forms of activity k thus dissuade l from all his work speaking really not in my own character but in efnes of course it is absolutely essential that l shd do a work which may be superbly good tuesday january ls melancholy continues so much so that he declared this morning he couldnt work the consequence has been rather a melancholy day outside it is very cold grey too we walked in richmond park this afternoon the trees all black the sky heavy over london but there is enough colour to make it even lovelier today than on bright days i think the deer exactly match the bracken but l was melancholy as i say all i can do is to unsay all i have said to say what i really mean its a bad habit writing novelsit falsifies life t think however after praising ls writing very sincerely for minutes he says stop whereupon i stop theres no more to be said when i analyse his mood i attribute much of it to sheer lack of self confidence in his power of writing as if he mightnt be a writer after all being a practical man his melancholy sinks far deeper than the half assumed melancholy of self conscious people like lytton sir leslie myself theres no arguing with him well im reading the idiot i cant bear the style of it very often at the same time he seems to me to have the same kind of vitality in him that scott had only scott merely made superb ordinary people d creates wonders with very subtle brains fearful sufferings perhaps the likeness to scott partly consists in the loose free easy style of the translation i am also reading michelet plodding through the dreary middle ages fanny kembles life yesterday in the train i read the rape of the lock which seems to me supremealmost superhuman in its beauty brilliancyyou really cant believe that such things are written down i think one day i shall write a book of eccentrics mr grote shall be one lady hester stanhope margaret fuller duchess of newcastle aunt julia wednesday january having finished a chapter i went off buying small fragments of things part of the morning for one thing i saw a mass of pinkish stuff in the fishmongers bought itcods roe then i made carbon copies of some notes of ls about arbitration the action of nature has relieved his spirits more than all the arguments of his wifealso the day was fine anyhow one may now hope he will get started which is the main thing he went to the school of economics after lunch i to westminster i want to see as many houses as possible but in barton st the rent is that is low on account of the war westminster noiseless shadowed by the abbey is almost the heart of london by this time it was raining i went to days found my books already sent when i tried to remember the name of one i failed utterly so one must feel in an examination i read essay upon criticism waiting for my train at hammersmith the classics make the time pass much better than the pall mall gazette maynard keynes came to dinner we gave him oysters he is like quicksilver on a sloping boarda little inhuman but very kindly as inhuman people are we gossiped at full speed about adrian karin adrians lovemaking done in loud judicious tones of course marjorie jos here though friendly very amusing i thought k a little inhuman he saw the queerness the fun but didnt seem to see that it might be serious nessa ottoline he says contrived the whole thing then we talked about the war we arent fighting now he says but only waiting for the spring meantime we lavish money on a scale which makes the french who are fearfully out at elbow gape with admiration we are bound to win in great style too having at the last moment applied all our brains all our wealth to the problem thursday january maynard last night was sceptical about the value of writing on arbitrationhe was sceptical about the value of almost all work save for the pleasure it gives the worker he works only because he likes it this of course depressed poor l once more he was very melancholy this morning had to spend the day at the british museum which was bad enough even if one believed in ones drudgery still i believe it will be an enormous success if it doesnt prevent another war it will put him among the eminent young men which isnt altogether despicable i went to the london librarya stale culture smoked place which i detest here i read gilbert murray on immortality got a book for l so home missing my train reading the letter to dr arbuthnot on hammersmith station l came in late having been up to hampstead seen janet who seems still the same but so i think it must be for months emphie annoyed with margaret who advises a proper rest cure which one doesnt do to the patient herself sylvia milman came to dinner after a good deal of bowing scraping about china which she has dutifully seen in her endeavour to be advanced we got on to memories of childhood which amused me but bored l im afraid no one ever had a duller home than she had but by sheer hard work without a scrap of talent she has plodded after the advanced ie nessa until she lives in a flat saves money to travel helps at the omega ida is nursing in france enid maud have a chicken farm clearly there was good stuff in the dean though never a spark of enthusiasm she stayed on on until l half rose from his chair friday january when l pulled the curtains this morning practically no light came in there was a kind of greyish confusion outsidesoft swirling incessant snow this has gone on all day almost sometimes changing to rain the green itself is very lovely lights up the room with its pure white glare but the streets became brown directly of course in this house of trouble the pipes burst or got choked or the roof split asunder anyhow in the middle ofthe morning i heard a steady rush of water in the wainscoat mr le grys lizzie various people have been clambering about the roof ever since the water still drips through the ceiling into a row of slop pails mrs le grys cries hysterically o itll be all rightyoure insured the plumber refuses to leave his house in weather like this we are going to hear the fabians at essex hall daresay we shall be swept out of our beds tonight its a queer winterthe worst i ever knew suitable for the war all the rest of it i never said yesterday that i heard from thomas hardy he wrote a very nice very characteristic letter was much pleased that i wrote so that my nocturnal impulse was from god saturday january the fabians were well worth hearing still more worth seeing miss atkinson drivelled at length about peacei could understand always confute generally all that she said so that i think it must have been very bad the interest was watching mrs webb seated like an industrious spider at the table spinning her webs a pun incessantly the hall was full of earnest drab women who are thought queer at home rejoice in it of broad nosed sallow shock headed young men in brown tweed suits they all looked unhealthy singular impotent the only speech that was worth anything came from squire who wears a bright blue shirt cultivates an amusing appearance he said it was all very dull sensiblewhich it was the idea that these frail webspinners can affect the destiny of nations seems to me fantastic but it was well worth going k i have now declared myself a fabian we stayed in richmond all day we walked up the river were startled by the sudden fall of an avalanche of snow from a roof it was very cold misty jean asked us to go hear some vads sing but the fire after tea was too tempting oliver ray dined with us oliver as usual very prompt impatient rather testy ray solid capable soothing we discussed the war k marjorie i cant bear to think of it its too revolting o shuddered after saying that m must of course live with jos as his mistress ray says she divides the world into those who are nice enough to be in love with k those who arentk marjorie isnt they think her in lovebut in love too with the drama of the situation they share our fears toobut agree that anything in her case is better than nothing sunday january in the middle of dinner last night molly rang us up to ask whether she k desmond might come to lunch today oliver exclaimed that desmond as he happened to know had promised to lunch with henry james we told molly this it was news to her so she came alone about we plunged of course into gordon square gossip she has suffered acutely this winter owing to a series of embroilments with clive the nature of which i can imagine though whether he got bored first or she disgusted i dont know anyhow as i could have foretold after violent scenes lasting almost months they have parted k he abuses her k she abuses herselffor ever having listened but she finds that an intermittent acquaintance wont do for himgarden party talk he calls it k she feels that intimacy in those circles leads to a kind of dustiness of soul so she has broken k now takes desmond off to freshwater for months to live cheaply k write a novel this is the very last attemptk it sounds a little desperate he is to come up to town once in weeks she is to manage children k the house with only one servant and she means never again to come back into the whirl moreover they have quarrelled with his mother k forfeited a year so they must live on which includes desmonds weekly article in the new statesman she was incoherent inattentive k fragmentary as usual like a little grey moth among machines l went to see his mother i called on jean whom i found sitting in black velvet in a room like a cheap restaurant with brilliant lights and there was old mrs thomas too knitting incessantly we talked about waterpipes soldiers so home to a quiet evening thank god monday january my birthday let me count up all the things i had l had sworn he would give me nothing like a good wife i believed him but he crept into my bed with a little parcel which was a beautiful green purse and he brought up breakfast with a paper which announced a naval victory we have sunk a german battle ship a square brown parcel with the abbot in ita lovely first edition so i had a very merry pleasing morningwhich indeed was only surpassed by the afternoon i was then taken up to town free of charge given a treat first at a picture palace then at buszards dont think ive had a birthday treat for io years it felt like one toobeing a fine frosty day everything brisk cheerful as it should be but never is the picture palace was a little disappointingas we never got to the war pictures after waiting hour a half but to make up we exactly caught a nonstop train i have been very happy reading father on pope which is very witty bright without a single dead sentence in it in fact i dont know when i have enjoyed a birthday so muchnot since i was a child anyhow sitting at tea we decided three things in the first place to take hogarth if we can get it in the second to buy a printing press in the third to buy a bull dog probably called john i am very much excited at the idea of all threeparticularly the press i was also given a packet of sweets to bring home tuesday january l went up to the school of economics this morning i wrote as usual over the fire with an occasional interruption by lizzy who is like a rough coated young carthorse with muddy hoofs after lunch i met l at the gates of kew gardens we walked back to richmond through the gardens which are now one feels teeming with buds bulbs though not a spike shows he has already grasped his arbitrationsuch is the male mind will i see go through with it straight off here i make my prophesy it will be a great success lead to as much work as he wants as molly sighed it must be wonderful to have a husband who works i think it would be much odder to have one who didnt mrs woolf clara are coming to dinner so i must stop wednesday january mrs woolf clara came to dinner i dont know what it is about themi daresay id better not try to define it perhaps their voices partlypartly their manners anyhow they gave us flowers chocolates mrs w sat knitted clara smoked i think jewesses are somehow discontented clara is mrs w has the mind of a child she is amused by everything yet understands nothingsays whatever comes into her headprattles incessantly now good humoured now ill humoured she seems to like everyone equally as if they were all the same she told us how she used to go to bed with a basket of socks by her side so as to start darning first thing in the morning leonard went up to the school of economics today i wrote then went to janet emphie the cook have influenzai was met by an elder sistera shrewd sensible elderly woman who has taken charge of things janet seemed better said she was better we talked about my novel which everyone so i predict will assure me is the most brilliant thing theyve ever read privately condemn as indeed it deserves to be condemned about shelley poets their immorality she said that in her young days she would have disapproved of shelleys relations with women but the old sister dodged in out which made conversation about morality uneasy home finished pope so to bed thursday january leonard off again to lunch with the webbs have his committee meeting once more i wrote all these days i may remark are semidark lightening a little about pm before their final plunge into darkness yet i think even this darkness is the darkness of very early spring not winter darkness any more i decided to go to london for the sake of hearing the strand roar which i think one does want after a day or two of richmond somehow one cant take richmond seriously one has always come here for an outing i suppose that is part of its charm but one wants serious life sometimes as i dressed my watch fell on the floor sitting at tea in a shop in the strand i found that the hands pointed to still though it went on ticking so i took it to frodshams in south molton street where i made great play with the name of mccabe the fact that the watch had been over years in my family frodsham claims to be the only genuine watchmaker in london the rest are jewellers i saw a beautiful woman in the bus who could hardly contain her laughter because a great military gentleman was thrown on to her lap like a sack of coals which seemed to tickle her greatly the more she laughed the nicer i thought her about one person in a fortnight seems to me nice j most are nothing at all home to find l triumphant from his committee meeting he is to do as he likes squire throws out hints that they would like him to edit the blue book supplement for them well i told you so a new servant has come today lizzy left carrying a brown paper parcel k whistling loudlyi wonder where she has gone friday january shall i say nothing happened today as we used to do in our diaries when they were beginning to die it wouldnt be true the day is rather like a leafless tree there are all sorts of colours in it if you look closely but the outline is bare enough we worked after lunch we walked down the river to that great mediaeval building which juts out into the river it is i think a vast mill and we came back early so that l might have tea before he went to a committee at hampstead after that i bought our food did not observe much of interest but the fact of the day for me has been a vague kind of discomfort caused by the eccentric character of the new servant maud when one speaks to her she stops dead looks at the ceiling she bursts into the room just to see if you are there she is an angular woman of about who never stays long in any place i believe she lives in dread of something she puts down plates with a start mrs le grys says that she herself is going mad with mauds peculiarities she has just announced that she is the daughter ofa colonel i am sure her brain is full of illusions poor creature i shouldnt be surprised at anything the only question is how she contrives to exist saturday january l went to chancellors this morning about hogarth they now volunteer that mrs wontner wishes to stay onbut will let us know on monday for certain it is a great nuisance i have a nose for a house that was a perfect house if ever there was one we went to wimbledon this afternoon on the strength of savages information that there was a beautiful house there to let wimbledon is a dreary high bleak windy suburb on the edge of a threadbare heath and savages house is an enlarged villa with a rent of furnished overlooked by motor omnibuses standing on the road in all ways therefore utterly unsuited to us we came home by bus the world grew steadily nicer as we came to richmond certainly it is the first of the suburbs by a long way because it is not an offshoot of london any more than oxford or marlborough is it was icy cold i had the grace to remember that many bus conductors are shivering today but only stabs at my own comfort make me remember other peopleunlike l mauds secret obsession i believe is that she is a lady she attempts genteel talk about the weather as a colonels daughter very well might mutters something when she brings in the coal about being accustomed to private work she is certainly cleaner than lizzie i hope her mania wont develop my corn is cured i cannot get on with michelets middle ages l has indian blue books to review he was kept late at hampstead didnt get home till when we had hot chocolate over the fire he read janet the three jews sunday ji january o dear we quarrelled almost all the morning it was a lovely morning now gone to hades for ever branded with the marks of our ill humour which began it which carried it on god knows this i will say i explode l smoulders however quite suddenly we made it up but the morning was wasted we walked after lunch in the park came home by way of hogarth tried to say that we shant be much disappointed if we dont get it anyhow it hasnt got the green in front of it after tea as no one came weve hardly seen anyone this week i started reading the wise virgins i read it straight on till bedtime when i finished it my opinion is that its a remarkable book very bad in parts first rate in others a writers book i think because only a writer perhaps can see why the good parts are so very good why the very bad parts arent very bad it seems to me to have the stuff of duke jones in it although there are howlers which wd make miss sidgwick turn grey i was made very happy by reading this i like the poetic side of l it gets a little smothered in bluebooks organisations monday february i had to go out shopping this morning so i called in on chancellors they say that mrs wontner makes conditions about taking on hogarth so that it is possible that she wont take it so here we are on the seesaw again mrs le grys also told me this morning of a house on the green doors off which is to let in march the rent is they want premium we went to look at it after luncheon but being a boarding house couldnt see over it what we saw was defaced in every possible way but a nice substantial house without the charms of hogarth but then with the addition ofthe green we went up to londonl to the london library i to days i walked with him across the green park in st james street there was a terrific explosion people came running out of clubs stopped still gazed about them but there was no zeppelin or aeroplaneonly i suppose a very large tyre burst but it is really an instinct with me most people i suppose to turn any sudden noise or dark object in the sky into an explosion or a german aeroplane and it always seems utterly impossible that one should be hurt i was annoyed in the usual way at days by the afternoon party of fashionable ladies looking for books we have just been rung up by chancellors who wish us to see the owner of hogarth tomorrow possibly by our presence respectability outwit mrs wontner whose demands have annoyed chancellors in fact it seems quite likely at this moment that we shall get hogarth wish it were tomorrow i am certain it is the best house to take tuesday february well it is tomorrow we are certainly nearer to hogarth than we were we have done little else thought of little else all day so it is as well we have some profit there are no entries in vws diary for the next ten days according to lws laconic record they went to chancellors about hogarth house during the afternoon of february on the following two days they made an afternoon walk on friday lw went to the london libraryand vw probably went too on saturday morning february they went to rye and stayed at the old flushing inn on sunday they walked to playden in the morning and to winchelsea in the afternoon on monday february they had an afternoon walk and on tuesday went to hastings for lunch and then returned to london where he dined with sydney waterlow at the cock tavern in fleet street and meeting ka cox and gerald shove there they went afterwards to her rooms which had once been his and vws in cliffords inn on friday february the woolfs again went to see hogarth house saturday february there was a great downpour this morning i am sure however many years i keep this diary i shall never find a winter to beat this it seems to have lost all self control we wrote after luncheon l went to the library i went to a concert at the queens hall i ran into oliver strachey standing very like a strachey in the hall because he dislikes sitting inside waiting for the music i got by luck a very good place for the hall was nearly full it was a divine concert but one of the things i decided as i listened its difficult not to think of other things was that all descriptions of music are quite worthless rather unpleasant they are apt to be hysterical to say things that people will be ashamed of having said afterwards they played haydn mozart no brandenburg concerto the unfinished i daresay the playing wasnt very good but the stream of melody was divine it struck me what an odd thing it was this little box of pure beauty set down in the middle of london streets peopleall looking so ordinary crowding to hear as if they werent ordinary after all or had an ambition for something better opposite me was bernard shaw grown a whitehaired benevolent old man down in the orchestra was walter lamb shining in his alabastrine baldness like a marble fountain i was annoyed by a young man woman next me who took advantage of the music to press each others hands read a shropshire lad look at some vile illustrations and other people eat chocolates crumbled the silver paper into balls i went to the wc at the tube station found a small party going on in that chaste recess the old woman had a vast female dog which was drinking water out of a tumbler her daughters were paying an afternoon call we were all very friendly in odd surroundingsi thought it very sensible to have no false shame i met l at spikings we had tea were very happy stopped at earls court called on his mother but she was out we were shown into a huge high sitting room in which was a minute old lady in semi darkness sitting on the edge of a sofa nothing could have been more forlorn l has now got another book of indian travels from the times he had just made up his mind that he was dismissed sunday february rain again today i cleaned silver which is an easy profitable thing to do it so soon shines again philip came he and l went for a walk he lunched with us stayed talking till they despair more than ever now of getting to the front all regular officers are preferred above them cecil has a machine gun which may lead to his going if so almost certainly to his being killed poor philip was a good deal agitated i thought with his prospects what is he to do after the war is over he thinks he must emigrate cecil would like to stay on in the army which however one cant do unless one has money neither of them has a penny five hundred a year is considerably more valuable than beauty or rank he stayed talking wanting to talk about himself perhaps had to go back to colchester where the only tolerable thing is the oysters the men he declares never cease joking the worse things are the more they joke then we walked down the river in the face of a cold gale which is now raging outside gladly came home to tea now sit as usual surrounded by books paper ink so shall sit till bedtimesave that i have some mending to do my entire skirt having split in two yesterday l is writing a review of his indian book i am now reading a later volume of michelet which is superb the only tolerable history the people next door are singing the same song that theyve been practising these monthsa hymn from all this it is clear that i dont want to mend my dress have nothing whatever to say monday february there is nothing to record of this morning except my conviction that mrs le grys is the best tempered woman in england if she gets her roomed house at southampton will make it a gigantic success we have only to hint that we want dog soap she washes max who badly wanted it we both went up to london this afternoon l to the library i to ramble about the west end picking up clothes i am really in rags it is very amusing with age too ones less afraid of the superb shop women these great shops are like fairies palaces now i swept about in debenhams marshalls so on buying as i thought with great discretion the shop women are often very charming in spite of their serpentine coils of black hair by the way i met walter lamb at dover street station a gentleman in frock coat top hat slip umbrella c accosted me i fairly laughed it was old wat who had just been lunching with an mps wife seeing all the grandees his satisfaction is amazing it oozes out everywhere then i had tea rambled down to charing cross in the dark making up phrases incidents to write about which is i expect the way one gets killed l went to tea at gordon sqre where he saw mrs hutchinson who is the present flame but a very smoky one clive anyhow approves our scheme ofa periodical he is a man of business whatever he may be as an artist i bought a ten elevenpenny blue dress in which i sit at this moment debenham freebody of wigmore street and marshall snelgrove oxford street mary hutchinson nee barnes b whose mother was a first cousin of lytton strachey in io she had married st john hutchinson see below june n she was for many years to come according to quentin

september the day looked so fine that we planned a picnic at telscombe however it turned windy with a strange black haze over die sunlike a sea mist gone black only in parts for it was very fine over

to go walking there k back to lewes to order our car for tomorrow i went round ms walk for the last time rain stopped but wind so tremendous that nessa k duncan wouldnt be able to come as arranged mushroom season evidently setting in found several on the top had to lean against the wind coming down great fall of walnuts men throwing sticks to bring them down couldnt work at the path a fine starry night however the woolfs returned to richmond on october after three months at asheham and vw began a new book for her diary see appendix iii the titlepage is inscribed hogarth house paradise road richmond oct monday october this attempt at a diary is begun on the impulse given by the discovery in a wooden box in my cupboard of an old volume kept in k still able to make us laugh at walter lamb this therefore will follow that planwritten after tea written indiscreetly k by the way i note here that l has promised to add his page when he has something to say his modesty is to be overcome we planned today to get him an autumn outfit in clothes k to stock me with paper k pens this is the happiest day that exists for me it rained steadily of course london seems unchanged making me think of the change there used to be when one was a child there was a man buying boots who had such a taste in boots that he knew different cuts k rows of nails k was very cross when told his pair was nice k strong i hate nice strong boots he growled evidently there is a taste in boots we walked through gough sqre dr johnsons house a fine very well kept place not so shabby as i expected a little square folded in behind chancery lane given over to printing presses this is the best part of london to look atnot i now think to live in carrying my manuscript to the times i felt like a hack much in keeping we left it with a porter ran into bruce richmond shining out a perfect gentleman in white gloves on the ludgate hill platform he flourished his hat disappeared liz has a son therefore our fears as to paternity are set at rest tuesday october we had a horrid shock l came in so unreasonably cheerful that i guessed a disaster he has been called up though rather dashed for minutes my spirit mounted to a certainty that save the nuisance we have nothing to fear but the nuisancewaiting a week examination at at kingstonvisits to craig wright for certificatesis considerable it was piteous to see him shivering physically shivering so that we lit his gas fire only by degrees became more or less where we were in spirits still if one could wake to find it untrue it would be a mercy we took a proof of the first page of kms story the prelude it looks very nice set solid in the new type masses of bookbinding equipment from emma vaughan arrived this morningrather a testimony to her fads for it is all good i suppose she never bound a book but this is uncharitable considering we had a short walk by the river as it is a fine fairly still evening perhaps i shall have a raid to describe tomorrow trissie is staying her holiday with us i forget how many people rang us up this morning alix for one who wants to start her work apparently we have a liver bacon clumber spaniel in view living at wimbledon the property of a man taken for the army the k shuttleworths advertise the birth of a boy with the statement his perfect gift a good title for an academy picture or a mrs ward novel rather a terrible testimony to the limelight now desired by the rich upon their sacrifices wednesday io october no air raid no further disturbance by our countrys needs in fact l made out in his bath that he deserved some good fortune opening his letters found a cheque for from a swedish paper which never was born yet pays its debts and i had for myself late last night i was told to have my henry james done if possible on friday so that i had to make way with it this morning as i rather grudge time spent on articles yet cant help spending it if i have it i am rather glad that this is now out of my power and another article upon the country in hardy e bronte is suggested we walked down the river through the park back to an early tea at this moment l is bringing the club into existence i am sitting over the fire we have the prospect of k mansfield to dinner when many delicate things fall to be discussed we notice how backward the leaves are in falling yellowing here compared with asheham it might still be august save for the acorns scattered on the pathsuggesting to us the mysterious dispensation which causes them to perish or we should be a forest of oaks thursday october the dinner last night went off the delicate things were discussed vwe could both wish that ones first impression of km was not that she stinks like awell civet cat that had taken to street walking in truth im a little shocked by her commonness at first sight lines so hard cheap however when this diminishes she is so intelligent inscrutable that she repays friendship my sayingchaste the unchastewas exaggerated by murry for reasons of his own reasons that make him wish all of a sudden to break with garsington we discussed henry james km was illuminating i thought a munition worker called leslie moor came to fetch heranother of these females on the border land of propriety naturally inhabiting the underworldrather vivacious sallow skinned without any attachment to one place rather than another today poor l had to go the round of drs committees with a visit to squire thrown in his certifications are repeated he weighs only i bought my winter store of gloves got a reference in the london library met l at spikings for tea heaven blessed us by sending a quick train we came home very glad to be home over our fire though we had to light it cook up our dinner owing to the servants off day sunday october that is an awful confession seems to show the signs of death already spreading in this book i have excuses though we were rung up asked to dine with the bells in soho this i regret to say led to much argument we put off going to kingston the night was wet l didnt want old arguments in short were brought out with an edge to them so we went dolefully enough found the place behind the palace dined with roger nina hamnet saxon barbara a party such as might figure in a wells novel i enjoyed it though l was a model of selfcontrol clives remarks tended to prove that he is at the centre of everything but not so aggressive as usual nessa has found her governesssent apparently by the hand of god then on saturdaywhat happened saturday was entirely given over to the military we are safe again so they say for ever our appearance smoothed every obstacle by walking across kingston we got to the doctor about all was over by half past i waited in a great square surrounded by barrack buildings was reminded of a cambridge collegesoldiers crossing coming out of staircases going into others but gravel no grass a disagreeable impression of control senseless determination a great boarhound emblem of military dignity i suppose strolled across by himself l was a good deal insulted the drs referred to him as the chap with senile tremor through a curtain mercifully the impression slowly vanished as we went about richmond herbert came to tea bringing the dog tinker a stout active bold brute brown white with large luminous eyes reminding me a little of dominic springrice we have taken him for a walk but directly he is loosed he leaps walls dashes into open doors behaves like a spirit in quest of something not to be found we doubt rather if we can cope with him have i put down our manx cat also presented to us one day this week l is up at hampstead we are to have alix lilian harris to dinner monday i october the chief fact today i think is the development discovery of tinkers characterall in the right direction he was taken a long walk by the river the avenue the park his spirit is great but almost under control he fell into the river twice jumped out again circled madly with a black poodle investigated several garden gates which seem to have a fascination for him he is a human dog aloof from other dogs alix lilian were much as usual last night save that lilian had a dark patch on the top of her head heard almost perfectly the dark patch is a cup for catching sound a more modest amiable yet quietly well informed resolute character does not exist her principles are invariably liberal although her character is naturally conservativerather a good mixture moreover she has always depended on her brain thus discusses with great sense any question so long as it isnt art that comes up alix has the same air of level headed desperation solid capacious but as low in tone as a coal cellar however we found her very anxious to take on our work comes to learn tomorrow manx is sitting on ls knee tinker occasionally looks at him tuesday october its odd how fate crams money into our mouths when weve got enough starves us when were empty here weve made i think in bah lias this morning they write to say that mitchells is paying in so that brings us another two years ago we had awkward debts had to sell out to pay them we both make big or fairly big cheques monthly by reviewing we started printing in earnest after lunch alix came punctually was instructed left on her high stool while we took the air with tinkler who jumped from a parapet into a boat covered with tarpaulin crashed through out again unhurt though surprised we came back to find perera wearing his slip diamond initial in his tie as usual in fact the poor little mahogany coloured wretch has no variety of subjects the character of the governor the sins of the colonial office these are his topics always the same stories the same point of view the same likeness to a caged monkey suave on the surface inscrutable beyond he made me uncomfortable by producing an envelope of lacea souvenir from ceylon mrs woolfmore correctly a bribe but there was no choice but to take it he being gone upstairs alix solemnly slowly explained that she was bored also worried by her hours composing wished to give it up a sort of morbid scrutiny of values of motives joined with crass laziness leads her to this decision as i expect it will lead her to many more she has a good brain but not enough vitality to keep it working the idea weighed upon her i assured her there was no need for it to weigh wednesday ij october i went up to the show of pictures at heals this afternoon l having spent the morning at a coop conference first i stood at mudies counter while a stout widow chose io novels taking them from the hand of mudies man like a lapdog only stipulating that she wanted no vulgarity not much description but plenty of incident her companion recommended south windmuch praised by the reviewsall clever conversation italy but i cant bear conversationi like sensation said the widow gulped down another mass of sweet sensation warranted not about the war nor about drunkards i must really reduce my subscription to i think she observed waddled off with her ten volumes to woking so i guessed ottoline was not at her ease closely buttoned up in black velvet hat like a parasol satin collar pearls tinted eyelids red gold hair needless rioting in lw collaborated with them in preparing their case see hi lw a slip was a sort of underwaistcoat providing white edges to the neck opening of the waistcoat proper vws duckworth halfbrothers who were sticklers for correctness wore one during the day in town so did walter lamb ci mrs dalloway p to say one saw nothing of the pictures aldous huxley was thereinfinitely long lean with one opaque white eye a nice youth we walked up down a gallery discussing his aunt mrs humphry ward the mystery of her character deepens her charm wit character all marked as a woman full of knowledge k humour then her novels these are partly explained by arnold who brought them near bankruptcy years ago she rescued the whole lot by driving her pen day night we had tea with roger i was very much conscious of strainott languid taking refuge in her great ladyhood which is always depressing they both seemed to have their quarrel before their eyes i walked with her in the downpour to oxford street she buying me crimson carnations without cordiality thursday october l out until at his conference the telephone rang constantly so i thought as i tried to pin mrs meynell down in a review a dull life without him even tinklers restless mind did not make up ones right hand becomes quite cramped holding his chain let loose he is very random but on the whole obedient i had my tea in the kitchen l came as i finished it we sit surrounded by kittens dogs who now verge upon a suspicious relationship of some sort we now expect ka this i must say applies to tinker not to l friday october the sweetness of kas nature so we thought is triumphing over the bureaucracy which threatened to straitwaistcoat all her charm not but what office life isnt a pool past which one has to lead her she complains of falling hair but looked to me softer rosier more of the smoothness of cream than for a long while she spent the night was down with her leather case in hand to catch an early train i had a letter from nessa about servants so went up to mrs hunts this afternoona mysterious building all glass compartments leading to a space given up to the ironing washing of pink blue pinafores or so it looked not a parlourmaid to be had with some skilful manipulation of trains i reached the aeolian hall paid my shilling heard a very long very lovely schubert octet coming out i saw a grey shockheaded woman without a hatalix we had tea at spikings she has a kind of independence lack of concern for appearances which i admire but as we walked up down dover street she seemed on the verge of rolling up the usual veil of laughter k gossip k revealing her sepulchral despairpoor woman where are you going now alix i really dont know well that sounds dismal dont you look forward to say eleven tomorrow morning i merely wish it didnt exist thats all so i left her hatless aimless unattached wandering in piccadilly saturday october happily or she might say unhappily for alix she didnt presumably wander in piccadilly all night or the great bomb which ploughed up the pavement opposite swan k edgars might have dug her grave we heard two soft distant but unmistakable shocks about then a third which shook the window then silence it turns out that a zeppelin came over hovered unseen for an hour or two k left we heard no more of it difficult emotional relationship she first met vw in and proved a dependable friend during her illnesses in she had organised serbian refugee camps in corsica and was now a temporary principal in the war trade statistical department going out for a walk we ran into a smooth sleek provincial looking man at the pillar box our waltersent by heaven for the baptism of this book i think and he stuck to us for hours walked with us came back to tea would with encouragement which flagged have dined his stories were all of lord canterbury mrs saxton noble the ra each story throwing a gleam of light upon his own success or tact or prosperity not much gossip about the king however he prefers the queen mad princess victoria who breaks into his room announces that she means to live in his house his complexion is that of a wax figure his head is as smooth as an egg he has the same cultivated taste in books style that he used to have though no longer a writer or indeed anything but a secretary to the president to whom he seems filial parasitic to us his attitude is half friendly half suspicious he has cast in his lot with the orthodox but cant make up his mind to lose the other world entirely sunday october lytton came to luncheon goldie to dinnerso we must have talked for or hours we walked down the river through the park lytton in good spirits having finished a book of words though now pretending that it cant be published he means to leave london live for ever in the country at this moment saxon oliver are inspecting houses in berkshire it seems a good thing that ones friends should try experiments poor old goldie is evidently beyond that stage if i were malicious i should say he had reached the stage of the complete conversationalist a long story at dinner very skillfully told suited to keep the high table amused then facts with leonard after dinner one finds less power of detachment in the elderly this war seems to possess him to leave little over in fact he looked shrunk worn infinitely good charming devoted every ounce of vitality rightly appliedno time for experiments not enough curiosity perhaps though extreme kindliness sympathy which in the case of young men becomes amorous he has been asked to go to russia for the manchester guardian but doubts if he will get a passport monday october the moon grows full the evening trains are packed with people j leaving london we saw the hole in piccadilly this afternoon traffic has been stopped the public slowly tramps past the place which workmen are mending though they look small in comparison with it swan edgar has every window covered with sacking or planks you see shop women looking out from behind not a glimpse of stuffs but business goes on as usual so they say windows are broken according to no rule some intact some this side some that our london library stands whole however we found our books came home in the tube standing the whole way to hammersmith have just come in bert is wounded nellie has gone to liz she felt it her duty also her rightwhich shows how the servant is bettering her state in this generation v tuesday october another lapse in this book i must confess but if i do it against my humour i shall begin to loathe it so the one chance of life it has is to submit to lapses uncomplainingly i remember though that we walked printed margaret came to tea how pale these elderly women get the rough pale skin of toads unfortunately m in particular easily loses the flash of her beauty this time we were whelmed in the coop revolution the characters of mr king mr may possibilitieset an occasional swinge ofthe tail which reminds me ofthe extremely insignificant position i have in this important world i get a little depressed a little anxious to find faulta question of not being in the right atmosphere l i suppose feels the same about gordon sqre and then the minute care which the elderly solicitous take of each other impresses me must be back or lilian will be anxious questions of fatigue or cold always cropping up fpartly the unmarried state perhaps partly the sense of being the centre of j ones world which margaret very naturally hasbut of course her niceness valiancy always conquer me in spite of injured vanity wednesday october l to some confounded meeting but also to take our selected sample of paper to mr byles whom he met coming out of the new statesman office i did a little printing then up to janet with time one would naturally welcome wet wind already the worst chill of them is over because one thinks of them as safety against the raid so today i hardly grumbled though it was heavy rain cold dark inhuman primeval weather the case menage is extremely cheerful to step into such a welcome such anxiety about china tea or indian an egg fresh bread butterclothes dried with a duster emphie spirited discursive inconsecutive as usual about her day her ecko a hearing aid servants sugar honey all fresh sensible evidently the fruit of experience which has not embittered or aged her though it has not given her much power of concentration she went to write her notes after tea this is her great occupation janet i talked getting on well as usual but i was packed off to wait minutes at finchley road lest i should miss my train k travelled with a mother three boys who made all the elderly gentlemen shy yet cordial to watch their kisses antics from behind their newspapers thursday october owing to the usual circumstances i had to spend the day recumbent however this is much mitigated by printing which i do from my bed on the sloping table we took off a proof of pages on paper of the right size liked the looks of it immensely our paper will be soft yellow tinted a melancholy letter from ott this morning complaining of age ugliness the weariness of london the sadness of not being wanted all so true i suppose that we have accepted an invitation on my part rather out of pity though also a feeling of liking for her persists saxon barbara dined with us we are lending asheham to the whole of that curious constellationnick saxon will revolve round barbara who lws meeting was as a member of the editorial board of the small monthly magazine war and peace which propagated the ideas of norman angell as expounded in his book the great illusion the offices ofthe new statesman were then in great queen street wc r b byles was its manager from until his death in no doubt lw sought his technical advice in connection with the printing problems of the hogarth press he then had tea with mr perera at the national liberal club twinkles rosily but modestly in the light of their admiration very neat nice motherly saxon as usual when with hergentle giving off a sound as of a boiling but not over boiling kettle speechless of course as she has only simple direct things to say l i were a little sleepy but we have arranged that she is to take up printing when nick goes back to france i am going to asheham on monday with saxon friday october either it is cold or wet or windy at night so we sleep well though the moon is now almost full we are faced with the problem of providing for tinker his spirits make him an exacting guest we went to find a home with the vet today discovered that a vet lives in part of the great red house at the back of us we looked into a room laid for tea the tablecloth laid like a diamond across the table a girl came i saw a black white paved hall evidently a fine house now cut up into different bits nelly has just come back the usual laughter begins again we gave lottie for doing so well saturday j october we were just setting off for kingston barracks this afternoon to get ls exemption card when the telephone rang i heard clives now unfamiliar apparently rather nervous voice asking whether he might dine with us so the breach is to be repaired very rapidly we walked through the park to kingston failed to get the card then had tea in kingston ending by buying me a watch for my wrista round bright serviceable turnip which i look at constantly really find it a saver of time we were back late clive came was i thought very pleasant easy garrulous starting a great many hares chasing them smartly letting off his little tributes to himself quite inoffensively he is so brisk well kept mentally that i like an evening of him l immensely good tempered urbane into the bargain we gossiped spun swiftly from thing to thingcharacters french books the mansfield intrigue so on he wears his chestnut suit combs his hair back to hide the bald spot but didnt hitch his trousers so much as usualin short he was at his best adrian has a drs order not to work on the land any longer sunday october still no raids presumably the haze at evening keeps them off though it is still the moon perfectly clear the numbers who have gone out of london this week must feel a little foolish a perfect cold october day sun red through the leaves which are still hanging in order to keep as much in ls company as i could i determined to go to staines with him we walked from shepperton through laleham so to staines by the river flat very quiet country or country just turning into town pink arm chairs were drawn up round a crowded but not luxurious tea table a multiplicity of little plates minute knives people told to help themselves mr lock with some impediment was there soon alice flora clara sylvia all appearedmalice suggested the whole of kensington high street poured into a room the normality of it all impressed me nothing beautiful nothing definite most strange why nature has produced this type in such abundance then the servant said mr sturgeon flora cried i will go dashed from the room everyone said oh ah how splendid as if on the stage which indeed the whole scene might have been we went after the nd act tinker dashed off but was recovered so home very cold herbert looked in here we sit over the fire i wish it were this time next week on monday october while l w was away vw went with saxon sydneyturner to asheham she left him there and went on to charleston returning to hogarth house on friday there are two characteristic entries in the asheham diaryinot repeated here friday november it almost is this time next week though not quitein fact not nearly since l is giving a lecture at birkenhead at this precise moment will then i suppose travel all night across england before reaching me i find it impossible to read after a railway journey i cant open dante or think of him without a shudderthe cause being i think partly the enormous numbers of newspapers ive been reading in lottie brought me all the timess which have accumulated i feel as if id moved about a great deal kept moving to keep myself warm i mean asheham charleston were rather in the nature of distractions so as not to think how strange solitary i was not solitary in the literal sense of course first i spent days with saxon much detail rather heightened by his greater warmth of intimacy he is still surprised by his own sensations takes them out sees how they fit in very anxious to be sure of their quality of course the quality is very high the worst one can say is that his lack of virility tends to prettify belittle to some extent but i daresay this is the effect of bs not very marked or magnificent nature and of course too hes exquisite in his own way so pure wise good sensitive most curiously unable to cope with anything needing decision his instinct is obviously always to avoid risk by remaining motionless when forced to order coal or a cab his indecision is that of a spinster of and yet intellectually he is definite enough definite but meticulous hes in love yet content that b should marry nick there was the new governess miss edwards at charleston a very pretty rather sharp not very well bred or well educated young woman who has i should imagine lived on the capital of her large eyes flaxen hair straight dark eyebrows so much that she is a little out of it in an element where these attractions are discounted there is no one to make eyes atsave bunny who remains impervious but she controls julian talks french evidently rather more naturally than english i meant to ask her what she thinks in yesterday it rained all day so i sat in writing about aksakoff in the morning sitting in the studio after luncheon duncan painted a table k nessa copied a giotto i unpacked all my bits of gossip they are very large in effect these painters very little selfconscious they have smooth broad spaces in their minds where i am all prickles k promontoriesnevertheless to my thinking few people have a more vigorous grasp or a more direct pounce than nessa two little boys with very active minds keep her in exercise i like the feeling that she gives ofa whole nature in use in working order i mean living practically not an amateur as duncan k bunny both to some extent are of course i suppose this is the effect of children k of responsibility but i always remember it in her a love of the actual fact is strong in her julian came with his letter into my room this morning at once curled up on my bed went on reading a book with a picture of a bird of paradise in it he told me he had read gardiners history perhaps times he disliked kings because they were so dull but liked newcastle irish history bored him because it was shapeless as far as i could make out he couldnt see that either side was in the right about the american war which annoyed him k he thought if we had given way about the taxes we should have got our way without their knowing it as we have done with our other colonies quentin called him to lessons or he would have gone on at length i was a good deal impressed suddenly to find a child reasoning k inheriting these old puzzles gives one rather a shock it seems a pity there cant be a new history for each new generation k yet its queer to hand over the old things to the new brains i daresay hell do a lot of work one of these days is it a sign of age that ones interested k inclined to see great virtue in the youngest generation but i was glad to come home k feel my real life coming back again j i mean life here with l solitary is not quite the right word ones personality seems to echo out across space when hes not there to enclose all ones vibrations this is not very intelligibly written but the feeling itself is a strange oneas if marriage were a completing of the instrument k the sound of one alone penetrates as if it were a violin robbed of its orchestra or pianoa dull wet night so i shall sleep the raid happened of course with us away saturday sunday monday november the raid didnt actually happen but with our nerves in the state they are i should say lotties k nellys nerves the dipping down of the electric lights was taken as a sign of warning finally the lights went out k standing on the kitchen stairs i was deluged with certain knowledge that the extinction of light is in future our warning i looked out of the hall door however heard the usual patter k voices of suburbans coming home k then to bear out my assurance the lights suddenly came on again we went to bed k to sleep i woke minutes before k lay listening but heard nothing k was about at oclock to flatten out all my expectations when i heard l at the door k there he was with the softness of a mouse he had let himself in k breakfasted we talked for as long as we could things kept oozing out sudden silences k spurts divine contentment at being once more harmonious l travelled all night the most pungent of his tales is to me the story of the arguing k enquiring k experimenting mrs ekhard who thrust herself into all sorts of subjects with l while he cut down her trees the palms ofhis hands are still black from the soot of manchester bark we walked by the river k to bed rather early l having denied that he was at all tired tumbled asleep k slept till he was called on sunday i finished my aksakoff k writing has the advantage of making a weekday out of the sabbath in spite of the clamour k blare of military music k church bells which always takes place at about a noise which the other people have no right to inflict we went up the river k through the park for it was a lovely warm day k passed our walter again with a man who looked like a schoolmaster no deer are to be seen in the lower park where the cedars are and perera came to tea k i shut him alone with l having no wish for more yards of lace i think however that l is now menaced with a gold watch owing to the success ofthe ceylon business the daily news bursts out in three separate places in indignation and today weve been to london k just come back k sit waiting for dinner expecting life k smartness at least i spent d upon a magazine with mrs asquiths love letters k theyre as flat k feeble k vulgar k illiterate as a provincial mrs glyn might be with something insolent about them as though she condescended in scribbling we went to the london library as usual coming out ran in to the hatless dusky figure ls dame secretaire alix on her way to grope for facts which ls eye finds a good deal quicker we saw the hole in piccadilly almost mended though the glass is still broken l to williams k norgate about his book which kept him so long that i had time to despise mrs a pretty thoroughly in cliffords inn tea rooms the talk was heated l accused of low dealing in offering his book to bell margarets doing some arrangement may mrs eckhard was sydney waterlows motherinlaw lw stayed with her in manchester see iii lif j the ceylon business see above october n the daily news the most radical newspaper ofthe time had taken the matter up and held that there had been few more terrible indictments in the whole history of british colonial administration emma alice margaret margot asquith nee tennant in married as his second wife h h asquith liberal prime minister a woman of undisciplined intelligence unrestrained candour great vitality and feeling she was if potentially a political liability a stimulating influence upon society the magazine has not been traced elinor glyn was a successful romantic novelist be come to but the man an incompetent stupid creature who wont give way will have his rights hanging on a strap in the tube was malcolm macnaghten grey spruce prosperous looking tuesday november the melancholy fact is that tinker at the present moment is lost he was let out in the garden got into the next door house finding their garden door open presumably escaped this was discovered at lunch time when we had done l went off to look in the neighbourhood but without success we took the bus to kingston visited for the last time let us hope in our lives the recruiting office after waiting in the familiar room with the two wooden benches the towel hanging up the khaki coat l was summoned given his paper which states that he is permanently totally disabled we suppose this might fetch if sold however we were rather dashed by the loss ofthe spaniel whom we had come to like we gave information at the police office their immense kindness good sense much impressed us after taking notes ringing up kew c the police sergeant said much obliged to you sir its melancholy to be asking about lost dogs again after our experience with tim even i find it hard to be altogether sanguine saturday io november another melancholy fact is that ive let all these days passtwo of them wednesday k thursday because i was out late the third friday because i was too gloomy we were both too argumentative to make writing possible however to deal with the dissipations first though i dont admit they were the cause of the gloom nessa was up i had a bloomsbury afternoon first i took my watch to a man in poland street who says it needs cleaning only then i went to the omega where in the semidark roger was convoying three chattering frenchwomen round the show giving the impression as usual that french manners k language have a peculiar relish for him the pictures glimmered through the dusk k i was chiefly impressed by the gertlers vanessa too very good duncan i thought a little pretty or tending to be faith vacillated about llewelyn davies suggested mhp sussex letter to lw dated h sqre monday night that lw should get george bell son to publish it at once as a book it was finally published as cooperation and the future of industry by allen unwin in january see iii lw endeavouring to make me see her show of dresses this being private view day we had tea in the sewing roomwalking up k down munching dry cakewhile mabel stitched lining in a corner k roger wrote letters on his knee nessa came on top of this k we left i buying an apricot coloured coat on my way i had tea in gordon square which always puzzles me under the new arrangement there being no sitting room she is brooding some new educational scheme boys a tutor k a governess has planned it all for next summer miss edwards has taken to meeting soldiers on the downs k her capacity wont last long this was the prelude to a party at gordon square on thursday to which i went through the wet k the dirt a very long expedition for hours of life though i enjoyed it the usual people were there the usual sensation of being in a familiar but stimulating atmosphere in which all the people ones in the habit of thinking of were there in the body a great many mop headed young women in amber k emerald sitting on the floor molly vanessa k i represented mature matronhood oliver seemed to be the friendly k amorous uncle ray one might call the grandmother very commanding immensely well nourished k competent i spent most of my time with oliver k as the clock struck io i got up and wentan example of virtue if ever there was one and now we see how the gloom came about l was testy dispiriting k tepid we slept i woke to a sense of failure k hard treatment this persisted one wave breaking after another all day long we walked on the river bank in a cold wind under a grey sky both agreed that life seen without illusion is a ghastly affair illusions wouldnt come back however they returned about in front of the fire k were going merrily till bedtime when some antics ended the day today has been very cheerful in spite of the worst assortment of elements to be had bitter cold stormy sky rain l went to the lost dogs home but without success we have put up notices but hope runs low ive been without letters for days sunday november sunday i see is becoming for us much what it was to our fathers the day on which social life becomes swept k as its by the nature of things a dull solemn day the plan isnt so bad still i hardly see on what principle one can approve of our luncheon at the webbs l has known them in lws hand i rashly said that i would occasionally write a page here now v calls on me to redeem my word as it will take me from reading joseph chamberlains speeches i dont see why i shouldnt we went to the webbs for luncheon there too were mr mrs tawny i had met her but not him before they came the webbs told us that he was an idealist now that ive met him the only thing which i can add with certainty is that he is an idealist with black teeth one of the worst webb meals to which we have been v between webb tawny i between mrs w mrs t mrs w began to talk almost at once about the reconstruction committee which she is on she talked incessantly every tenth word was committee she has apparently succeeded in inventing a committee for babies a committee for lunatics a committee for the sick a committee for the disabled a committee for the dead but the scheme or the cosmos is not complete because she has so far failed to invent a committee for the ablebodied unemployed however she still has hopes meanwhile v at one corner i at another sunk in silence while mrs t vacuously asked w about the case of a woman with a broken hip in an infirmary in a union in walthamstow immediately after luncheon we fled took a bus from westminster to hammersmith very cold but refreshing after the discourse on committees when we got back here we found the room full of peoplerosalind toynbee arnold t ka i liked her small pale with dark eyes a wisp of hair still decided in her manner im not sure that i did much like him he seemed rather more commonplace conventional than the young man ones used to but we talked away briskly about art literature i observed rt thinking when spoken toa good sign as far as one can see she is so trained in culture that she is almost a specialist if one got to know her i mean one would find some carefully arranged theory netting in all her feelings about literature for example she doesnt like king lear but or perhaps therefore i thought her rather distinguished more so at any rate than the cropheads of bloomsbury as we sat with great rolls of fur in the shadow leant verify my guess as to the crophead in her case it struck me now then that her halfaristocratic parentage had produced a kind of old fashioned decorum in her her views upon the proper relation of cooks governesses were certainly decorous something i think may be due to the difference between oxford cambridge its strange to think how much ones mind has been affected by this differenceeven mine has i suppose though i was never there am by nature critical of them but arnold seemed to me not very easy to talk directly to monday november today weve been to london as usually happens on monday we went to the omega as we were looking round us in came roger which embarrassed me a little partly because of his own pictures also because i dont like talking of art in front of him he was in process of painting a table though disappeared then we went to gordon sqre to fetch my umbrella pictures a hair binder all left there who should open the door but clive he asked us in there was mh in one of the big armchairs a piteous half moon of a woman to my thinking she seems so crushed submissive always i half smoked a goldtipped cigarette listened to some garsington gossip km has broken with ott in a letter which says you shant play the countess to my cook any more or words to that effect we left however i went to mudies got the leading note in order to examine into rt more closely l went on to meet edgar for a mysterious interview i came home with mybook which does notseem a very masterly performance after turgenev i suppose but if you dont get your touches in the right place the method is apt to be sketchy empty l is at the suffrage i watch fireballs glowing red hot tuesday zj november i must again register my complaint that people wont write to me i dont write to them but how can one and no book from the times either for which im glad though as i want to get on with my novel the other day l began his book has already done two chapters hes like one of those mowing machines i used to watch from my window at asheham round k round they go without haste without rest until finally the little square of corn in the middle is cut all is done we began our printing off this afternoon our first discovery was the important one that the springs arent even or the balls different in weight weor l put this more or less right we printed copies of the first page but we should be glad of another press though the results are very good for the most part a very cold day indeed i might have remarked the beginning of winter no leaves to speak of left on the trees now a sharp chill in the air ones room after tea most emphatically a little centre of light in the midst of profound darkness l is making up a lecture hes giving at hammersmith im to preside over the womens guild wednesday november l gave his lecture i presided over my guild it always puzzles me to know why the women come unless they like sitting in a room not their own gas light free other women on other chairs they dont pay much attention apparently save mrs langston no one has a word to offer tonight mrs allana rosy bright eyed shrewd but not very enlightened woman spoke for an hour upon congress it might have been a report k had little more interest when shed done id done no questions were asked she started off upon foodnot the food of the country but the individual dinner k tea provided at torquay upon this subject she spoke fluently even passionately for minutes the vices of outside traders the virtues of self control were both illustrated at length l was back about after a more profitable evening at the udc where soldiers an indian were among the audience today the servants went to see bert in hospital at epsom l went to the dogs home with no result finally we walked towards kew noticed how the great chestnut trees were as black and bare as iron a dozen men stand fishing in the quiet water beneath the locka cheerful sign of undiminished stability we looked in spent half an hour talking to the little printer who has machines press for sale the difficulty is to decide but probably we shall buy one leave the refinements of perfection for the present which riddell thinks necessary but presumably cant provide besides these machines are running only cost or again a day of no letters thursday november again a day of no letters unless i can count my weekly reprimand in the supt for what i said or didnt say about arnolds poems about nature this time im almost inclined to answer useless though it is but i should like to protest against this flood of oxford superiority we printed off another page very successfully which took till tea time k then we went round in the semidarkness to the little printer who will come round any moment now to see the room for the press one little boy about the size of julian works for him yesterday his cellar was flooded by the ladies bath next door he is very precise in his language perhaps the result ofa semiliterary profession monday november the little printer came round at the end of the last page k stayed perhaps houruntil lottie had to ring the bell with meaning but as i dont suppose he dines himself the meaning may have been obscure we have advanced k for that bought the cutting press k stipulated that the printing press shall be here by jan th the difficulty about these people is their flow of language personal history must be told at length i believe its a form of good manners on friday we went to a concert walking out when the english piece came on into a disreputable side street clinging to the back of bond streminds one rather of a thackeray novela place for the footman of the great to gamble in tea at spikingsrwithsome of the upper classes who looked like pet dogs threatened with a cold bath they were talking of the scarcity of motor cars i bought a pair of stockings k then home the stockings were in preparation for garsington we came back from that adventure hours ago its difficult to give the whole impression save that it wasnt much unlike my imagination people strewn about in a sealingwax coloured room aldous huxley toying with great round disks of ivory green marblethe draughts of garsington brett in trousers philip tremendously encased in the best leather ottoline as usual velvet pearls pug dogs lytton semirecumbent in a vast chair too many nick nacks for real beauty too many scents silks a warm air which was a little heavy droves of people moved about from room to room from drawing room to dining room from dining room to ottolines roomall sunday at moments the sense of it seemed to flag k the day certainly lasted very long by these means fredegond was admitted in the morning k then after tea i had perhaps an hour over a log fire with ottoline going for a walk we ran into a motor full of speckled k not prepossessing young menone i entirely forget but he existed as i counted the most obvious was evan morgan a little red absurdity with a beak of a nose no chin k a general likeness to a very callow but student bantam cock who has run to legs k neck however he was evidently most carefully prepared to be a poet k an eccentricity both by his conversation which aimed at irresponsible brilliance lack of reticence k by his clothes which must have been copied from the usual shelley picture but he was as innocent as a chicken k so foolish that it didnt seem to matter on the whole i liked ottoline better than her friends have prepared one for liking her her vitality seemed to me a credit to her k in private talk her vapours give way to some quite clear bursts of shrewdness the horror of the garsington situation is great of course but to the outsider the obvious view is that o k p k garsington house provide a good deal which isnt accepted very graciously however to deal blame rightly in such a situation is beyond the wit of a human being theyve brought themselves to such a pass of intrigue k general intricacy of relationship that theyre hardly sane about each other in such conditions i think ott deserves some credit for keeping her ship in full sail as she certainly does we were made immensely comfortable a good deal of food the talk had frequent bare patches but then this particular carpet had been used fairly often by talking severely to philip l made him come up to parliament today he is a weak amiable long suffering man who seems generally to be making the best of things k seeing the best of people whom by nature he dislikes we came home by oxford where i bought writing books k l bought a pipe k we had coffee k saw the colleges then to reading where we lunched then to ealing where we changed to richmond on the top of our return alix appeared k has just left but i missed most of her feeling it necessary to have a bath thursday november i boasted so much about this book k the charm of filling it from a never exhausted fount at garsington that im ashamed to miss days k yet as i point out the only chance it has is to wait ones mood ottoline keeps one by the way devoted however to her inner life which made me reflect that i havent an inner lifeshe read me a passage in my praise though so the realities do come in sometimes on tuesday l went to williams k norgate who offer terms for a bookwhich must be considered evidently they want him very much k cant altogether conceal this in spite of their wish to drive a hard bargain i rather think i finished taking down a page anyhow on wednesday barbara came to make a start k the machine thereupon completely struck work one ofthe rollers being cut k jibbing k as our stock of ks ran out she could only set lines this she did however quickly k without fault so that she promises well she bicycled from wimbledon her small crop head bright cheeks brilliant waistcoat give her a likeness to some vivacious bird but i dont know that i think this very emphatic appearance particularly interesting it always seems to say now all the decks are cleared for action k action there is none i dined with roger met clive we sat at the low square table covered with a bandanna eat out of dishes each holding a different bean or lettuce delicious food for a change we drank wine finished with soft white cheese eaten with sugar then taking a splendid flight above personalities we discussed literature aesthetics dyou know clive ive made out a little more about the thing which is essential to all art you see all art is representative you say the word tree you see a tree very well now every word has an aura poetry combines the different auras in a sequence that was something like it i said one could k certainly did write with phrases not only words but that didnt help things on much roger asked me if i founded my writing upon texture or upon structure i connected structure with plot k therefore said texture then we discussed the meaning of structure k texture in painting k in writing then we discussed shakespeare k roger said giotto excited him just as much this went on till i made myself go precisely at io and we discussed also chinese poetry clive said the whole thing was too distant to be comprehensible roger compared the poetry with the painting i liked it all very much the talk i mean much no doubt is perfectly vague not to be taken seriously but the atmosphere puts ideas into ones head k instead of having to curtail them or expatiate one can speak them straight out k be understoodindeed disagreed with old roger takes a gloomy view not of our life but of the worlds future but i think i detected the influence of trotter k the herd k so i distrusted him still stepping out into charlotte street where the bloomsbury murder took place a week or two ago k seeing a crowd swarming in the road k hearing women abuse each other k at the noise others come running with delightall this sordidity made me think him rather likely to be right today has been a perfectly warm very still day k we just had time after printing off a page to reach the river k see everything reflected per fectly straightly in the water the red roof of a house had its own little cloud of red in the riverlights lit on the bridge made long streaks of yellowvery peaceful k as if the heart of winter friday november l went up to london with the rollers k i meant to go to kew on the way it struck me that one ought to decide things definitely one ought to make up ones mind to begin then i settled that if it was the d day at kew i wouldnt hesitate but decide not to go in it was the d day i turned without pausing k had therefore to walk back certainly this decision brings a feeling of peace though i rather think i was wrong it was a warm windless day the sky genuinely blue i counted my lumps of sugar but saxon came in k took one hadnt slept k so was cutting his office i meant to read brookes sermons k couldnt k saxon hadnt much to say we discussed the jealousy of vanity k the jealousy of affection he is immune from both i have the one k not the otherperhaps from lack of cause l came in after seeing squire whose insignificance takes the lustre from reviewing rather then came barbara who wanted a bath k saxon followed her k then clive came in k we chattered awayhe k i in duet for the most parttill when he went dressed like a newmarket gent in an immensely thick coat i find his sprightliness a rest no hunt for subjects needed he is after another before the first is disposed of he abused ott but frankly he discussed lady mary montagu his reviewsa publisher has offered him for a book of them he has become rather a raconteur but there is i think something intellectual about him something of the cambridge standard perhaps surviving hes no fool though his manners suggest overwhelming reasons for thinking him one now k thenthis perpetual effort to shine to be in the knowthis vanity a long talk with mh on the telephone interrupted him he has become a great writer of intimate letters he makes a business of knowing everyone or at any rate their affairs but i like this november today saturday the usual reasons have kept me recumbent in the mitigated form which allows setting up k distributing barbara brought the new rollers she lunched stayed to tea k has indeed only gone a short time which wont i hope become a habit monday november i dont like sunday the best thing is to make it a work day to unravel brookes mind to the sound of church bells was suitable enough such a wind in the night by the way that the milkman reported much damage down the road this morning raised our hopes which were dashed on going out to see nothing smashednot a stain of blood or even the remnant of a hat it was fine wet by turns with a high cold wind continuously we went to kew saw a blazing bush as red as cherry blossom but more intensefrostily redalso gulls rising falling for pieces of meat their crowd waved aside suddenly by three very elegant light grey cranes we also went into the orchid house where these sinister reptiles live in a tropical heat so that they come out in all their spotted streaked flesh even now in the cold they always make me anxious to bring them into a novel l went on to hampstead i back here where i had tea in the kitchen with the manx cat l saw margaret discussed labour i suppose his book i wish my range extended so far today i went into london with my ms leonard went to harrisons which entry was broken off somehowbut my recollection is that l found desmond at the ll together they look up the word fin the slang dictionary were saddened surprised to see how the thumb marks of members were thick on the page my afternoon was by comparison chaste though im hardly proud of the fact that i completely lost my way in seeking printing house square got into a maze of little half lit very busy professional looking streets which i should like to investigate the profession of journalism has its heart here carts were standing lengthwise for bales to be dumped into a kind man in uniform something at a warehouse he told me took me to the times at last though i still managed to miss my way i think it must have been for i remember walking rapidly in the wrong direction which got darker darker until i became suspicious went back againbut this is a week old monday december its impossible to remember a week at a stretch which i must confess would be my task if i were to pretend to be accurate one day i went to the dentist we had barbara here for days with disastrous results for when we looked at herworkit was so full of faults we had to take it down i should have expected not much intelligence but the quickness accuracy of a good needlewoman this was annoying on saturday l gave a lecture at hampstead strange what a stamp hampstead sets even on a casual gathering of people such clean decorous uncompromising high minded old ladies old gentlemen the young wearing brown clothes thinking seriously the women dowdy the men narrow shouldered bright fire lights books surrounding us everyone of course agreeing beforehand to what was said old dr clark indeed could quote clauses in treaties by their numbers hobson was shrewd judicious kindly janet came in looking very well but we had to race off in the tube to leicester sqre to dine with barbara saxon a young woman called g then on to figaro at the old vic its perfectly lovely breaking from one beauty into another so romantic as well as witty the perfection of music vindication of opera on sunday we heard of cecils death philips wounds we walked along the river in the afternoon when l came back from staines came to an old hollow elm tree in the sawdust of which someone so we guessed had stuck a match the wind was blowing in k soon the flames were running high a crowd stopped the first old gentleman was so positive that i believed him he said it was a usual process done to get rid of an old tree nothing to marvel at no question of accident or malice k so he marched on with obvious contentment the second old gentleman admitted doubts finally swung round to our view that no one would burn a tree down on the public path on a sunday too meanwhile the tree burnt rather beautifully we called at the police office k told them in case the fire might run along by means of bushes to other trees leonards cold very bada horrid nuisance today he stayed in k set up lines i went to harrison to mudies to the times with an article on mrs drew k am just come in frostily cold night stars polished to their brightest so much brighter than the streets are i lost my way again k as no one knows where printing house sqre is one has full scope for wandering in i got the nd vol of ld morleys memories a real solid book i think like the books father used to buy looking like them too an ugly red one night walter lamb dropped in as we sat over the fire his proud crest is a little dashed i think by my overpowering snobbery wednesday december our apprentice weighs rather heavily upon us for one thing though im always ashamed in her presence to feel this her presence is rather in the way of our complete comfort it may be her youth something highly polished so as to reflect without depth about her on the other hand shes nice considerate one can be open with her the real drawback is her work today has been spent by l in the futile misery of trying to print from one of her pages which wont lock up as the other page had to be entirely taken down reset her work amounts to nil less than nil considering ls time wasted a bitter cold day too our only outing after dark to the printers to borrow inverted commas yesterday l saw philip at fishmongers hall i set up in one room barbara in the other these days indoors dont provide much in the way of incident pass with the swiftest rush so that at oclock the present hour one seems only starting on the days workperhaps the result of passing without question straight from one occupation to another l reading life of dilke worried by a flea up his back im past the middle of purgatorio but find it stiff the meaning more than the language i think we got hardys new poems but lent them to philip thursday december when i wrote that we were only at the beginning of our days work last night i spoke more truly than i knew nothing was further from our minds than air raids a bitter night no moon up till eleven at however i was wakened by l to a most instant sense of guns as if ones faculties jumped up fully dressed we took clothes quilts a watch a torch the guns sounding nearer as we went down stairs to sit with the servants on the ancient black horse hair chest wrapped in quilts in the kitchen passage lottie having said she felt bad passed on to a general rattle of jokes comments which almost silenced the guns they fired very quickly apparently towards barnes slowly die sounds got more distant finally ceased we unwrapped ourselves went back to bed in ten minutes there could be no question of staying there guns apparently at kew up we jumped more hastily this time since i remember leaving my watch trailing cloak stockings behind me servants apparently calm even jocose in fact one talks through the noise rather bored by having to talk at am than anything else guns at one point so loud that die whistle of the shell going up followed the explosion one window did i think rattle then silence cocoa was brewed for us off we went again having trained ones ears to listen one cant get them not to for a time as it was after carts were rolling out of stables motor cars dirobbing then prolonged ghostly whistlings which meant i suppose belgian work people recalled to the munitions factory at last in the distance i heard bugles l was by diis time asleep but the dutiful boy scouts came down our road wakened him carefully it struck me how sentimental the suggestion of the sound was how thousands of old ladies were offering up their thanksgivings at the sound connecting him a boy scout with small angel wings with some joyful vision and then i went to sleep but the servants sat up with their heads out of the window in the bitter coldfrost white on the roofsuntil the bugle sounded when they went back to the kitchen and sat there till breakfast the logic of die proceeding escapes me today we have printed discussed the raid which according to the star i bought was the work of gothas attacking in squadrons were brought down a perfectly still fine winters day so about tomorrow morning perhaps friday december but there was no raid as the moon wanes no doubt we are free for a month happily no apprentice today which gives a sense of holiday we have had to make it rather clear to barbara that this job may not be followed by another she refuses payment for last week so theres no fault to find with her no one could be nicer yet she has the soul of the lake not of the sea or is one too romantic exacting in what one expectsanyhow nothing is more fascinating than a live person always i changing resisting yeilding against ones forecast this is true even of barbara not the most variable or gifted of her kind nessa was up about a governess mrs brereton suggested in place of the faultfinding k man hunting miss e so i ended my afternoon in one of the great soft chairs at gordon square i like the sense of space deep large pattern one gets there i sat alone for minutes reading a book on children sex when nessa came we had tea it was discovered that clive mary were in the house norton came in the same party as usual as usual to my liking so much alive so full of information of the latest kind real interest in every sort of art in people too i rather expect l to disagree with all this i judge by the amount of animation of brain produced in myself sense of thoughts all liberated not that mh open her lips but she has an air of mute sympathy i like norton tooall that brain hoarded in his head for the most exalted ends which makes his criticism always impartial clive starts his topicslavishing admiration notice upon nessa which doesnt make me jealous as once it did when the swing of that pendulum carried so much of my fortune with it at any rate of my comfort maynard says that bonar law has dished the government the country entirely with lansdowne the government unable to stick to its own declarations this was from lord reading it sometimes occurs to me that theres not a single secret in politics everything is to be guessed from the newspapers nessa had to go round to rogers i walked with her buying sausages cheese for a supper party on the way roger is becoming one of the successes of the day as a painter of perfectly literal very unpleasant portraits today saturday we walked to twickenham where leonard took train for staines i found marny when i got back its she has just gone so that if i dont cover the next pages with family gossip detail of all sorts its not for want of it let me put a little of it down if i can rememberbut it goes so fast turns to ashes without the atmosphere but florence bishop

papers but lettice doesnt like london at all but herbert does she goes back to sheffield for change of air when the raids come we go sit with the wales on the ground floor but they ought to tell one

in their only daughter virginia b was working as a land girl at terling place near witham essex the germans themselves i went out onto the landing met a lady though it was dressed for going out she told mec c sunday monday tuesday wednesdays wednesday being the th of december a melancholy record the truth is when were not printing therefore dont have barbara here we do jobs in london get back late im disinclined to get out pen ink on sunday lytton came to tea i was alone for l went to margaret i enjoyed it very muchhe is one of the most supple of our friends i dont mean passionate or masterful or original but the person whose mind seems softest to impressions least starched by any formality or impediment there is his great gift of expression of course never to me at its best in writing but making him in some respects the most sympathetic understanding friend to talk to moreover he has become or now shows it more fully curiously gentle sweet tempered considerate if one adds his peculiar flavour of mind his wit infinite intelligencenot brain but intelligencehe is a figure not to be replaced by any other combination intimacy seems to me possible with him as with scarcely any one for besides tastes in common i like think i understand his feelingseven in their more capricious developments for example in the matter of carrington he spoke of her by the way with a candour not flattering though not at all malicious that woman will dog mehe remarked she wont let me write i daresay ottoline was saying you would end by marrying her god the mere notion is enough one thing i knowill never marry anyone but if shes in love with you well then she must take her chance i believe im sometimes jealous of her thats inconceivable you like me better dont you he said he did we laughed remarked on our wish for an intimate correspondent but how to overcome the difficulties should we attempt it perhaps he brought us his gordon next day he was to take the book to chatto windus monday december today was a string of meetings for l out to lunch to philip to another meeting k not back till i pacing the room in some anxiety till i heard him my afternoon was very nearly normal to mudies tea in an abc reading a life of gaudier brzeska home again wet soft vaporous day tuesday december the infliction of our apprentice things on the whole went better l i slipped out for half an hour before tea into the brownish red light of the wintry afternoon the green gives a very good sample of the sky bare trees one or two old rooks nests in the upper twigs back to tea perera came for private talk i own that i sounded the very depths of boredom with barbara she gives out facts precisely as she received them minute facts about governesses houses and no doubt of her own adequacy crosses her mind all so nice honest sensible how can there be a flaw indeed one figures her nature as a flawless marble impervious unatmospheric and the time passed she missed her train waited on for anotherwaited until we were to dine at my evening fretted away without sensation save of one standing under the drip of a water spout my excuse for such extravagance is that i had to go in to the guild today no speaker came we were clearing the table at after a lot of letter reading intermittent discussion when a private omen came true the speaker arrived a mrs moore from kensal rise middle class dressed in velvet vulgar fluent spoke on propaganda for minutes more words than brain indeed she couldnt explain her sayings to the satisfaction of mrs langston k was perturbed when i showed how much i knew but i admired the way in which she got her steam up when we were all anxious to go the women said it was a splendid speech sentences that melt into each other impress them wednesday december this morning ruined by the tears k plaints of lottie who thinks her work too hard k finally demanded higher wages which she could easily get k so could nell i lost my temper k told her to get them then up came nelly in a conciliatory mood regretting lotties outburst though pointing out the hardships of our printingroom so untidywork endless had meant to ask a rise in februaryeveryones wages raised of course we had to pay extra for food but then wed got to we were very amicable no difficulty about money but ls taunts seemed to me unpleasanti charged her to find out the truthif there is such a thing in the midst of that bluster at last she went walked by the river having done a little printing thursday december by careful arrangement i limited the reconciliation scene with lottie to minutes at eleven sharp she sobbed repented took back everything shed said told me how her temper had led to constant rows at frys as they call it all a fabrication about over work k the more people we had k the more mess we made the better she liked it she begged me not to tell anyone she kissed me k went off like a chastened child leaving me with a mixture of pity k i suppose self complacency the poor have no chance no manners or self control to protect themselves with we have a monopoly of all the generous feelingsi daresay this isnt quite true but theres some meaning in it poverty degrades as gissing saidbarbara had a cold k didnt come to my relief certainly but thats inaccurate she came after luncheon k brought a letter from nessa who invites her to be governess there for a month pending mrs brereton barbara was so sensible k matter of fact that i repented k certainly she treats us with the strictest honesty making a serious undertaking of the printing here the light went out which is creditable k one could depend upon her i fancy to keep the exact letter of her promise she went off directly after tea to conduct one of those curious gatherings of nick oliver k saxon k carrington about their house in the country the work of furnishing has fallen of course upon carrington but barbara is a good second k keeps the accounts which will end i assured her by absorbing all her money on things shell never be paid for friday december today we went to see philip at fishmongers hall rather a strange place a few feet from london bridge a pompous hall with a porter a gigantic fire for that porter a german gun k within banisters draped with crimson folds of stuff as if for a royal visit nelsons flag in a glass case dick whittington in plaster standing in an alcove a branching staircase taking one to a great gallery now divided into cubicles two or three nurses sat sewing outside we found philip up his chair by the open window looking into the street which was noisy just catching sight of the river i saw a notice warning patients not to throw cigarette ends out or they might catch inflammable bales upon the wharf to me philip looked well though there was that absentmindedness which one sees in nick i suppose to philip these days pass in a dream from which he finds himself detached i can imagine that he is puzzled why he doesnt feel more he still talks of we k our things i thought he must look to going back again with something like hope but he talked very easily cheerfullyabout horses books so on another mana great burly cavalry officer was reading his book in a far corner unused to reading books i should think nurses seemed very kindly a feeling ofthe uselessness of it all breaking these people mending them again was in the air i thought we asked philip to asheham when he can move home to find sidney waterlow already in the chair by the fire he was in very good feather k rolled out the word i with a sort of tremor of pride he has indeed negotiated treaties in paris since we met being self conscious k diffident his triumphs give him enormous pleasure there is the same tremor of half incredulous self approbation in his tone when he talks of his children i laughed at him about our quarrel he had thought it all over so he saidas if it mattered k was highly pleased by the removal of the cloud saxon came very late to dinner i gave it him k he told me how selfish alix wascant pack her own boxes waits for carrington saxon attributes this to love i believe its in imitation of the beloved she has picked it up from james sees it in him k thinks it stands for the consciousness of superiority i believe sydney stayed the night k saxon stayed till eleven k he only spoke times k then rather pedantically in his old way which he has rather dropped lately saturday december a cold but sunny day it seems long since we had a day to ourselves no printing done we took a walk in the old style through the park down the avenue k back by the river which was flooding up fast k cut us off making us creep along a railing so as to reach dry land the streets remind me of cambridge streets people walk down the middle this is partly because of the queues waiting to buy at lip tons one has some difficulty in keeping on the pavement k the motor buses are always grazing peoples sides home k a large tea by ourselves masses of papers perera of course to consult one more k he is still sitting with l in his room monday december monday as i think ive noted before is our marketing daybut im forgetting molly maccarthy k walter lamb last nightthe thing arose in this way wat offered us the loan of his norfolk maps thinking it a little cool to borrow without invitation we asked him to bring them we then found ourselves faced with the unbearable prospect of unmitigated walter but who to get at the last moment the strachey household denuded owing to tidmarsh squire engaged at last the idea of molly came to me k heaven granted this favour im not sure that her deafness doesnt lend her a kind of piquancy like a stammer she on thursday december the woolfs went to asheham for christmas vw made one entry in her asheham diary a summary report on food supplies weather and visitors which is recapitulated in the next entry written on her return to hogarth house thursday january i forget who it was that came in at this moment k i have excuse for forgetting since it is now thursday rd jan k were just back from asheham i remember though that the last days were full of people walter k molly as i began to relate she has sent her novel to chatto k windus k calls it the band on the pier or ring fence the last dull i thinkwl spruce k a little suspicious when the royal familyappeared as it did wouldnt shoot at those rabbits again for my diversion and then i can remember that we had ka who contemplates resignation k then the night after bob with his pockets bulging with georgian poetry his talk all of books k prices asked for printing k number of copies sold in the midst of which nelly burst in to say that the take cover had sounded so we had our dinner partly in the cellar bob talking at such a rate that it was necessary to listen at the window for the guns loud enough though they were i remember him attached to a large plate of suet pudding in the basement l sitting on a wooden box in the coal hole reading the paper finding one of my red pens there all clear sounded about io a bad raid though barbara saxon suffered more than we did at hampstead after thatthe very next nightwe went to the club dinner a great deal of eating by some people at long tables waiters thudding swing doors imitated guns so successfully that various officials came round warned one of a raid joswedgwood made a speech i noticed poor marjorie listening with her eyes on her lap she came up from darlington was dressed poor creature in muslin picked out with red roses cut low though every one else was more or less in working clothes fur capes i was caught in the net of sylvia whifham who cross examined me about her husbands novels in despair of revealing my true opinion i pretended never to have read wolfgangmost suitably of all our friends shes the one to have a bomb dropped next door to receive it without surprise and shes taking to literature begins by translating flaubert a remarkable instance of a person without gift of any kind always pushing along in the wake of other more advanced people next day we went to asheham the journey was the worst in our record hours spent mostly outside clapham junction fog bitter cold every move stopping short in a minute or two motored out i remember found the roads under snow but very pleasant coming into the drawing room save that we were without milk one of the coldest finest of christmases rather to our relief we spent it alone ray falling ill ka coming for week end nessas children there was the usual visit from maynard clive my usual failure to get to charleston corresponding to nessas failure to get to asheham i spent a night there enjoyed myself through the rather obtuse barrier of poor bunny who took to his bed at one point without sympathy from nessa who had often put him to bed she said for no perceivable cause duncan came back from london with gossip for us chiefly about alix a party at the play who broke the partition dropped cigarettes had to be asked to leavebut what i like most about asheham is that i read books there so divine it is coming in from a walk to have tea by the fire then read readsay othellosay anything it doesnt seem to matter what but ones faculties are so oddly clarified that the page de taches itself in its true meaning lies as if illumined before ones eyes seen whole truly not in jerks spasms as so often in london and then the trees spare leafless the brown of the plough yesterday downs mountainous through a mist which isnt palpable for only dead detail vanishes the live grows larger larger fires can be seen burning through solitary sportsmen beat up duck snipe on the marshes windows were almost always frozen in the morning each blade rough with frost partridges would come sit in the field lifeless little lumps they looked half stiff with cold perhaps the diary habit has come to life at charleston bunny sat up late on the old years night writing duncan came back with a ledger bought in lambs conduit street the sad thing is that we darent trust each other to read our books they lie like vast consciences in our most secret drawers clive by the way enlivened christmas by a small book of versethe prose fantastically foppish the verse very pretty light to my mind by wh i mean not altogether to ls mind he can do his little owl very efficientlyanyhow i prefer it to the last georgian effortbound in blue this year housing that ridiculous squire so we come to an end ofthe year any attempt to sum it up is beyond me or even to cast a final glance at the evening paper with news from russia which has just come in and drawn l to remark a very interesting state of things and whats going to happen no human being can foretell that the end friday january theres no reason after all why one should expect special events for the first page of a new book still one does so i may count three facts of different importance our first use of the club talk of peace the breaking of my tortoiseshell spectacles this talk of peace after all the most important of the three comes to the surface with a kind of tremor of hope once in months then subsides then swells again what it now amounts to one doesnt even like to guess having a sort of superstition about guessing at any rate one cant help feeling something moving one may wake to find the covered murmur proclaimed in every newspaper the club is a success on the basis of one tea we met alix settled in already an habitue by the fire together with a knot of very youthful revolutionaries one officer two sallow democratic officials the rooms are light bear traces of omega are less formal than usual before this i did my usual round partridge coopers walk through lincolns inn fields to mudies l passing his afternoon in committees margaret has just rung up to consult him on certain peace maneuvres in which she figures talk with alix about possible books she might write ones wretched without workoh perfectly wretched she echoed with a glance in the direction of james i suppose no hope of writing well i see things as they are saturday january we went to hampton court for the first time since we skated there so i believe we walked across bushey park a troop of horses took the opportunity to run from one side to the other the gilt statue was surrounded by ice k the ice had an inch of water on it i broke through with my umbrella the beds at hampton court are uniformly brown save for one yellow one pink flower primulas i think there were sacks at intervals which l thought might be laid down for the gymnastic exercises of mrs creighton we looked in at her windows as usual we saw nothing but those great vellum folios containing italian history so i suppose we walked along a raised bank beneath trees to the river sat on one of the semicircle of empty wooden seats it was cold but still then we took a tram to kingston had tea at atkinsons where one may have no more than a single bun everything is skimped now most of the butchers shops are shut the only open shop was besieged you cant buy chocolates or toffee flowers cost so much that i have to pick leaves instead we have cards for most foods the only abundant shop windows are the drapers other shops parade tins or cardboard boxes doubtless empty this is an attempt at the concise historic style suddenly one has come to notice the war everywhere i suppose there must be some undisturbed pockets of luxury somewhere stillup in northumbrian or cornish farm houses perhaps but the general table is pretty bare papers however flourish by spending d we are supplied with enough to light a weeks fires a man called richardson works out a highly complex mathematical method of voting in the trenches sunday january an infernal wet day i left l at the station he having to go to hampstead to answer a list of questions for margaret home to tea alone alix fredegond for supper the talk after flaunting round clive barbara garsington c settled upon conscience social duties tolstoy gerald shove read tolstoy the other day determined to give up tobacco but now argues that tolstoys commands were for men of looser life than he so that he may smoke cigarettes he thinks seriously of starting a nursery garden after the war threatens to give up their capital whats the use of that l demanded thats the worst of all things to do we dont want people to live on a week psychologically it may be necessary if one is to abolish capitalism i remarked i dont agree said alix besides who would he give his capital to in the ideal state everyone would have a year l went on please tell me some reason that i can remember to take back to gerald fredegond pleaded i forget now what the reason was hes got an awful conscience she continued he ate a large christmas dinner then he his brother sent out for preserved fruit when they had finished them they were miserable weve behaved like pigs were brutes they cried they were both miserable l gave us a great many reasons why we should keep what we have do good work for nothing i still feel however that my fire is too large for one person im one of those who are hampered by the psychological hindrance of owning j capital alix represented some sturdy hardheaded economy derived m from stracheys after this long argument it was time for them to go monday january to london today l with my jacks article to the times i to spiller about my spectacles i must get a new pair at a cost of after that we met at the london library then to tea at the club where alix almost plays hostess the woman still smokes her pipe in the corner lytton came in i finished my tea with him he is bargaining with chatto windus about his book when im asked if i like tidmarsh i say the country suits me he said rather cryptically his mild benignancy with the young ladies fredegond faith alix very noticeable i told him he wrote too much after the pattern of macaulay i see you didnt really like gordon he said he was quite unmoved contented almost sleek people going in out all the time make it difficult to talk chief topic the approach of peace save that the evening papers throw doubts upon it tuesday january as a sign of the times we live in i note that fredegond who wants to spend some months in london is advised by her practical friends to live in a hotel they say that she would have difficulty in getting food even if she found a servant or a room to live in consequently she is taking rooms at the thackeray hotel some fragments came to mind today which having nothing to record i may as well put down how i went to a registry office for nessa noticed that the woman had or pens on her table tried one after another found all save one unusable nibs stuck to the holder with crusts of ink one night last summer getting down from a bus i saw a fish bag left on the seat gave it to the woman in front of me she thanked me said with half a smirk that comes of me not being used to carrying a bag the bag was evidently the mark ofa lower social scalethere were of course other fragments which at hint of needing them dissolve in my mind its odd considering their triviality how these little scenes come up again again at odd moments are thought of reenacted disappear odd too how one thinks by help of pictures of surroundings yesterday i couldnt remember whether id left a book in my room and then i saw myself moving my spectacles remembered that i moved my spectacles in order to put the book down sure enough there it was id give a good deal to know something of psychology that was one of the books i suggested that alix should write but whats the good if one cant do it really well to the printers mcdermott today find him calmly asserting that he really cant send the press on the th cant find anyone to move it this is cool as he took our on the understanding we should have the press without fail however these chilly half animate overworked little creatures cant be taken seriously they dont attach the same meaning to promises even written stamped promises that we do people badgering him with small jobs he said k hasnt even the time to claim his money for the first time for weeks or months i spent a whole afternoon shopping coppers accumulate in my purse parcels hang from every finger shop people cross shops crowded in fact a most disagreeable duty when done in a mass wednesday january the club is something ofa lure certainly promises better conditions for tea than a shop so having gone for my spectacles i went to gerrard street found fredegond faith there also a large semicircle of cambridge youths including a young man with a flop of hair who had written a play which he had with him the pipesmoking girl one or two others was amused at the repetition of certain old scenes from my own pastthe obvious excitement sense of being the latest best though not outwardly the most lovely of gods works of having things to say for the first time in history there was all this the young men so wonderful in the eyes of the young women young women so desirable in the eyes ofthe young men though this was not perceptible to me sitting elderly upon my sofa this sort of talk ah but have you read his play do you approve most decidedly i do and you like the handling oh immensely then a second less favoured young woman leans forward says but may i see it certainly says the youth produces it from a despatch box to the girls delight i represent the public ediths so unconventional however then i was summoned to have my tea at the far end of the room lytton came in carrying lord morley whom hes reviewing for l we tried still to overhear young cambridge lytton finally decamped on my daring him to that party now grown even larger by the addition of several young men with large foreheads hair combed back in hiding from the police i then had some private talk with faith according to her nick is getting a great deal of pain from the saxon barbara nick combination his claims are disregarded barbara prefers saxon seems to be ashamed of the unintellectuality of nick she wont take him to see her bloomsbury friends bloomsbury i think will have one more corpse to its credit for poor bs attainments arent such as to give her a very secure footing there to my thinking a marriage with nick offers more solid value than a cold blooded only semireal attachment with saxon i explained my view with which both faith fredegond agreed i promised kindness in case kindness persuades barbara that theres more in n than she sees her snobbishness is irritating though natural in the street my grey knickers came off so it happened once to emmy fisher she wrapped a starving dog in them fredegond walked with me to charing cross i feel like her in some fundamental way thursday io january our pipes burst yesterday in the sudden thaw from sharp frost we changed in an hour or two to mildness lottie nelly dealt with this sensibly but we are without baths set up in the afternoon then to the printers l did not lose his temper little macdermott asserts that there was a verbal understanding that he need only deliver the press if his was put up so mild pertinacious muddle headed that we made no impression the truth is he takes us for amateurs who neednt be treated seriously we are to think things over friday january another sedentary day which must however be entered for the sake of recording that the lords have passed the suffrage bill i dont feel much more importantperhaps slightly so its like a knighthood might be useful to impress people one despises but there are other aspects of it naturally l to lunch with ka a serbian i set up now find it easily possible to finish a page in an afternoon l back we took a round by the river so home to tea a great many books life of keats at last saturday january now that printing has set in were at page there isnt much to write down though the day seems as well filled as a picture puzzle with succeeding events we are still without baths this lends some severity to other restrictions which we have to suffer today we can only get one small joint of beef which is to last a week there is no fat to be had no margarine no nutter we are reduced to lb of butter a week eggs are d each a chicken anything from to mrs langston made sunday dinner last week off sausages bread drippingnever had such a sunday dinner for years after printing we allow ourselves a short walk saw a vision of tinkerall but the nose accurate but each dog has an unmistakable impression the hope of peace all broken up again policies once more a running in every direction so far as one can tell monday january we had saxon to dinner on saturday he was at his lowest ebb it was impossible to talk to him but i guessed that he grieves over the inevitable frailty of mankind his dream of love friendship triumphing over jealousy has i expect been shattered by the latest developments he finds himself in a position odious to so scrupulous sensitive a man as he is still the effects arent enlivening for his friends even his gestures are weariful he has been nowhere seen no one i remember this fragment have you seen anyone saxon ive finished the third volume of the anthology he brought me two books of selections from italian literature he wrote my name in them with extreme dexterity neatness played chess with leonard was beaten which didnt add to his spirits left burdened with the mysteries of this unintelligible world on sunday clive came to tea he hadnt long settled in when the shoves arrived we spent an hour or two in gossip when one sees clive fairly often his devices for keeping up to the mark in the way of success brilliance become rather obvious we were all talking of the club upon which he rapped out i was among the haughty people who wouldnt join when they were asked now of course i find its the thing to do ive had to climb down the truth being that he wished to join was blackballed by l others such would be the truth of many of his stories i daresay if one knew but one doesnt know the results are quite agreeable however produced and as i persuaded him to lend me his typewriter for asheham ive no reason to be censorious his habits are like those of some faded beauty a touch of rouge a lock of yellow hair lips crimsoned we talked chiefly about the hypnotism exerted by bloomsbury over the younger generation some merriment over clives picture of the complete schoolmaster at tidmarsh f and g had gone there k after tea master pupil withdrew but in she carrington came to fetch a volume of lord macaulay later she asked to be enlightened about some anecdote of rousseau that youll know when youre older my dear said lytton paternally she took f aside confided to her some difficulty about barbara nick nick she said is reading hard as though there might be hope for him in that theyre all reading hard saxon asked maynard the other day whether he thought petronius suitable reading for a young lady who liked apuleius but the young ladies dont like apuleiuswhen theyre alone its matter for a comedy indeed i see the plots of many comedies brewing just now among our friends theres the comedy of alix bunny of james anonyma the tragicomedy of the two cockatoos after clive went f g stayed to dinner were more at their ease f told us of as wedding night undertaken by her from a dutiful wish to gain experience though the experience included so much autobiography on bs part ive no doubt eulogies ofhis father peans of the lesser literary lights of the day that i think she bought it dear but on the whole im feeling better partly owing to bunny f has a great turn for mimicry she mimicked karin breaking in late at night asking have you a bite for carry proceeding to ransack their larder karin slapping her thigh exclaiming well have a jaunt well crack a joke also karin bursting into tears one night from a sense that maynard c didnt want to see her in fact the dominion that bloomsbury exercises over the sane the insane alike seems to be sufficient to turn the brains of the most robust happily im bloomsbury myself thus immune but im not altogether ignorant of what they mean its a hypnotism very difficult to shake off because theres some foundation for it oddly though maynard seems to be the chief fount of the magic spirit talk about capital with gerald he says he means to part with his but i guess that he always has some scruple to play with as an intellectual exercise friday january another skip partly due to my writing a long letter to nessa which drained up some of the things i should have said here but i like this better than letter writing perhaps one should write novels for the of us only i can remember various doings however toynbees kot to dinner on tuesday january that afternoon lady strachey read to usto me for the most part as l was late she read ben jonsons masques they are short in between she broke off to talk a little so that it was lighter than before i enjoyed it she told me how she used to read everything at her school can remember the books because places are associated with them at the age of her father gave her leave to read tom jones i think on condition she never said shed read it told us that lyttons failure to get a fellowship had been one of the disappointments of her life one of the many well this next book wont be a disappointment i said but she thought the arnolds would object her pride in lytton desire to see him a noted literary character very evident i presumed on this that she was well disposed about tidmarsh but as she froze up pretended not to know where it was i suppose theres a family row indeed its easy to see that when fronted by the present shes not at her best conventional very nervous thinks theyre ruined once get her to the past she has no impediments of the sort told stories of beautiful dead patties dalrymples with the greatest animation how old pattle shot out of his tank thereby killed his wife who thought him come to life again how the sailors drank him dry on the voyage to england how dal was charming though not a good man to marry how dr jackson was so handsome kindin fact she seems to divide her life into the part of the exciting romantic illuminated play the rest of it is merely trudging along the prosaic streets with nothing to look forward to her eyes collapsed her teeth gone deaf but talk of the past or of literature it all lights up again literature too must be of the past though she read us a poem called the old way of a swashing patriotic kind exclaimed how fine it was how as long as we had hopwood for a poet we neednt complain her patriotism has survived everything else patriotism family feeling sights she saw long ago as for example you dont remember i suppose meeting me once on a bus when you were or you vanessa were with your mother she has the family gift of fantasy she ran out to get two little lozenge boxes which she has covered in scraps of coloured paper preserved from the catalogues of drapers shops she maynt read much or write plays patience by herselfi suppose she ruminates over her past according to her it was a splendid time to live in for one thing she remembers india before the mutiny splendid men they were the company servants your prinsep relations among the finest fancy my horror when i went to see the delhi pictures the other day found theyd called the prinsep pier the princes pier but talk of womens votes doesnt move her much from this ancient world we came back to one younger as far as years go than our own but the toynbees arent spiritually very young though surprisingly of our way of thinking which one takes to be young advanced still as to politics i rashly took this for granted arnold outdid me in antinationalism antipatriotism antimilitarism at intervals kot delivered a formal address upon russia in broken english theres a good deal to be said for kot he has some likeness to the russians of literature he will begin to explain his soul without preface he explained katherine mansfields soul not at all to her credit her lies poses have proved too much for him nor does he find more than a slight gift for writing in her i dont know that this last pleases me however though it sounds as if i wrote it down for that reason he is individual in his view of politics thinks russia too little civilised to profit by revolution but here in england its bound to come with immense benefit because weve carpets k gas in our poorest houses russia scarcely interests him he never means to go back prophesies civil war in the spring no advantage won by it in they were burning houses stabbing nobles too rosalind has merit to look at certainly i like her better than arnold who improves though is evidently harmless much in his element when discussing oxford he hadnt much good to say of it they were both sick of it will never go back nor does he think that young men will ever be found to live there again save as undergraduates he knew the aristocratic heroes who are now all killed celebratedgrenfells lister shaw steuart asquith loathed them for one reason they must have thought him a pale blooded little animal but he described their rows their insolence their quick snapping brains always winning scholarships bullying bringing bath chairs full of rats into chapel admitting no one to their set so that in the end they were almost abolished by the colonials who hated them back it reads much like a mrs ward novel wednesday th i went to the library where i met l who had been on his deputation to the colonial office which was illtreated by the secretary k then to the club where we met alix of course fredegond these two were making painful efforts to set up house together but neither could do anything decisive though it was clear that alix wished to come to terms as much as she can wish anything she had been down to sidmouth where her aunt lies paralysed doomed soon to die her eyelid just quivers k one side of her lip moves but in medical opinion she neither thinks nor feels this had not made alix either gloomier or less gloomy though i believe she feels it beneath her gentlemanly good sense as i left f beckoned k begged me to decide for her whether she should tell alix how gerald wished f not to share with her or prevaricate i always say that people with short hair must be told the truth i hear this saturday morning that they have an offer of ambers house which they should take i think in spite of gerald on thursday k friday k saturday we worked away at printing so as to have pages set up to print at mcdermotts unvarying cold k gloom which turns now to rain now to snow this is the hell of the year we seem to mark time in the mud wright dined with us on thursday night a kindly plausible but long winded man leaning on l for support at every point k giving up his views when they conflicted they went to see rowntree together i have my speculations but cant go into them now monday january we had nick to look at on saturday night barbara came too hes nothing very much to look at certainly yet so unpretending that what he has to show is satisfactory besides he has a pleasant irish voice k a quiet very simple manner which make him very tolerable in the house i rather think that barbara watched to see what we made of him he talked his own shop for the most part lewis guns their mechanism there are food riots strikes at woolwich the guards have notice to march there at any moment fire on the people which their own woolwich regiments would refuse to do he takes things a little seriously next morning we had a long discourse about irish character he admires synge says that hes heard his own men talk exactly as synge makes them talk they lie on the ground talking wont play games they are deeply religious the root of all evil in ireland he says die looking happy if the priest is with them not otherwise their mothers constantly write to know if a son has had a grand funeral if he has a cross over him this is their great source of comfort i suppose the soft serious rather plaintive disposition at which one guesses in nick is irish on top but not at all offensive there are signs of his deep admiration for the great bloomsbury group culture problems for instance he deplores the gulf between what he calls the quaker view the artists view k he says the quaker view will prevail with the young after the war he quotes books seriously however he went off to hampstead l went heaven knows what made him unless it was chess to gipsy hill to lunch with the waterlows lytton came to tea stayed to dinner about io oclock we both had that feeling of parched lips used up vivacity which comes from hours of talk but lytton was most easy agreeable among other things he gave us an amazing account of the british sex society which meets at hampstead the sound would suggest a third variety of human being it seems that the audience had that appearance notwithstanding they were surprisingly frank people of both sexes various ages discussed without shame such questions as the deformity of dean swifts penis whether cats use the wc self abuse incestincest between parent child when they are both unconscious of it was their main theme derived from freud think of becoming a member its unfortunate that civilisation always lights up the dwarfs cripples sexless people first and hampstead alone provides them lytton at different points exclaimed penis his contribution to the openness of the debate we also discussed the future of the world how we should like professions to exist no longer keats old age politics bloomsbury hypnotisma great many subjects l beat sydney by his craft they are leaving gipsy hill today monday i went to harrisons to have a broken tooth mended l to staines philip is back with his wound once more broken out owing to lack of care at fowey here i was interrupted on the verge of a description of london at the meeting of sun set moon rise i drove on top ofa bus from oxford st to victoria station observed how the passengers were watching the spectacle the same sense of interest mute attention shown as in the dress circle before some pageant a spring night blue sky with a smoke mist over the houses the shops were still lit but not the lamps so that there were bars of light all down the streets k in bond street i was at a loss to account for a great chandelier of light at the end of the street but it proved to be several shop windows jutting out into the road with lights on different tiers then at hyde park corner the search light rays out across the blue part of a pageant on a stage where all has been wonderfully muted down the gentleness of the scene was what impressed me a twilight view of london houses very large k looking stately now then someone as the moon came into view remarked upon the chance for an air raid we escaped though a cloud rising towards night wednesday january i see ive forgotten yesterday but it was uneventful l went up to a meeting barbara was left in control of the press i took a walk by myself i went along the river to marble hill i must retract what i said about the hell ofthe year we have glimpses of heaven so mild that the landing window is open i sat by the river watching a boat launched half expected to see buds on the willows river very high swift k yellow testifying to the floods higher up they say its been raining heavily i daresay it has but such is the civilisation of life in london that i really dont know what with fires electric light underground railways umbrellas how can one take notice of the weather but we look out about bed time k notice the moon very clear cut k polished k almost full till or so k then much as if god did turn over in his sleep k press a button down comes a curtain of cloud k we yawn k sleep sound last night after giving b her tea which wastes the chief delight of the day though poor woman she cant be better behaved k if she were gifted no doubt one would hate her actively we dined early k had the guild mr adams unidentified spoke the level is certainly not a high one even when they know their subject as he did they dont know it in such a way as to to make it plain to the uneducated i doubt whether more than people in the room knew that he was talking ofthe coops politics he began in the middle he read bald phrases from congress resolutions he could just pronounce such a word as autonomous but i dont suppose anyone understood it as usual l i were the only people to speak save mrs langston as usual it was only when talk drifted near food that one of the women broke silence she wanted a bread shop they all got bread late in the day for a time they all spoke at oncestories of their own ill treatment of their neighbours oddly phlegmatic these women for the most part with a passive sort of pleasure in sitting there watching like so many pale grey sea anemones stuck to their rocks still the children the houseworkexcuses enough if one troubled to look talking of sea anemones reminds me that were in treaty with d h lawrence for his house at zennor its very distant improbable at present though sufficiently tempting to make me think of that sea those cliffs several times a day today wednesday b didnt come we printed l did the most of it i made two little excursions into richmond one to discover the right way of spelling mynah the other to buy a new battery price two of mine have perished during the lifetime of ls methusaleh the wicked old wretch still burns like a spark from a star i think its wise to have mine in readiness for the raid though three tradespeople of richmond know for a certain that there will never be another the bakers windows now provide almost nothing but little plates of dull biscuits sections of plain cake little buns without any plums if you see a plum it is invariably a decoy plum there are no others this transformation scene has been stealing on imperceptibly last year were we still allowed iced cakes its unthinkable thursday january the last day of being one trembles to write the years that come after it all tinged with the shadow of another spring day i do without a fire in the morning the only drawback is the loss of a fire that sense of being in a cave of comfort with wet dark outside outside its a pale grey i went to the london library to get a handful of stories on the supernatural met sir henry newbolt a slim greyheaded weasel but we didnt know each other then i beat up down charing cross rd asking for keats letters but they were not to be had anywhere so to the club where i found lytton by himself not feeling inclined for talk we read our papers near together fredegond came in but after laughing a little at her telephone message i went she alix carrington getting together decided that i criticised them wouldnt stand it rang me up demanded a retraction which i would only give if they put their complaints in writing im afraid they wont do this they say i depress them the only explanation is that im a saddhist this is the first turn of the worm barbara however lets all criticism run off her without a trace l printed pages off at the printers today only got back at an unsatisfactory job owing to the incompetence of the printer friday january my birthday l slid a fine cows horn knife into my hand this morning nelly has knitted me a pair of red socks which tie round the ankle thus just suit my state in the morning another event kept me recumbent barbara came together we dissed pages l printed off the second at the printersaltogether a fine days work at this rate katherines story will be done in weeks we rather think of doing a little book of woodcuts either after this book or at the same time on our small press our dinner tonight was a sacrifice to duty on a fine scale never were we more ready for an evening alone books to read a sense of a great deal of talk already discharged this week but rather before came clara woolf the whithams whom we had asked with a view to killing each other off without more waste than was inevitable whithams elaborately literary get up is a fair index of his mind he is what the selftaught working man thinks genius should be yet so unassuming k homely that its more amusing than repulsive his passion for writing is the passion of the amateuror rather of the person whos got it up from a text book seeing cannans new novel he said ah cannan yeshes very weak in construction isnt he and so with all the rest he told me his books had a way of screaming with great enthusiasm after asking the fate of my fiction which is a point of honour in professional circles he ran over all the novels hes got ready or half ready or only in want of phrasingwhich process he applies at the end he begins with a synopsis which takes him months but i didnt listen to the whole story they withdraw soon to devonshire where directly the war ends but even the war hasnt prevented him from adding a new book to the list he is going to work hard writing all the morning reading walking the rest of the day and so we may hope for some whithams during the next five years or so when he had told us all this he went on about spiritualism their landlord being a fat pale solicitor of who lies on a sofa all day down in devonshire communing with spirits feeding upon bread margarine whitham had dabbled in mysticism had made tables walz heard phantom raps believed it all but was too much afraid of the results upon his character to go in for it seriously i thought this showed weakness and i expect he hasnt a good head on his shoulders as his talk of novel writing makes one perceive sylvia sat marking time much pleased with the good impression she thought him to make in her precise way acknowledged the most revolutionary principles so that they seemed the gossip of a good housekeeper about the price of bacon claras silence shows i think her subservient position in the family a person who can never make herself felt unhappy comfortless always i expect she stayed the night today saturday we went to kew snowdrops dwarf cyclamen some miniature rhododendrons out also the points of some squills or crocuses coming through the grass dead leaves sunday january as we were going out we ran flapslap into desmond bearing round the corner in an impetuous way this knocked the bottom from our hope ofa solitary evening but as mercifully as possible we took a turn in the old deer park he seemed depressed lines drawn upon his forehead he sighs oh dear oh dear at intervals thinking about the war or private difficulties i suppose indeed i thought it unpleasant how one has to steer past certain questions with him whens your book coming out has mollys novel been taken are you writing ci divine that the answers depress him acutely in the early morning we gave him tea discussed the development of psychology since shakespeares day l denied this i asserted it desmond thought othello desdemona very simple but thought we were tolerably represented in fiction i find myself altogether unmentioned there question whether one should write quick events in short scenes whether fiction should be like life whether thackeray has profundity desmond has read some of the newcomes lately finds no depth but a charming rippling conventional picturesqueness so on to bob trevelyans poetry a good commonplace poet said desmond not the kind to bring up discoveries from his own entrails looks upon the everyday world finds the right phrase classical therefore enduring but i dont follow this he brought enid bagnold in his pocket now im sure thinks hes reviewed her himself im not going to after a glance at her mind she led him to describe a roumanian prince whose voice he said was the loveliest in london he rang him up to account for not coming punctually for dinner i listened heard a soft hesitating voice stumbling over long words rather romantic down the telephone he went off at last having wrought himself into a state of contentment garrulity so that he would have stayed given the th act of the irenaid had he been able would have been able had we pressed monday january on monday i went to have my tooth finished winding up for tea at the club which becomes as goldie said quite a family party you come in to find half a dozen pairs of legs radiating from chairs towards the fire you hear or i heard its a case of revolution or evolution then if youve heard enough you seek the manchester guardian evade sylvia whitham hide yourself for precisely io seconds fredegond with apologies breaks through the barrier but theyre so fearfully dull i must talk something that isnt politics that something so far as i remember its saturday now was ottoline alix poetry love until bob who had been jerking his head towards us could stand it no longer but towered over us flapping an elongated proof sheet wishing to know if we were talking secrets no such luck i said so he settled down with his usual bagmans assortment of literary gossip first he said how clive proposes to buy up the egoist start a bloomsbury review then what did we think of waley so on k so on censorious scandal loving but innocent indefatigable as ever home i went there was a raid of course the night made it inevitable from to we roamed about between coal hole kitchen bedroom drawing room i dont know how much is fear how much boredom but the result is uncomfortable most of all i believe because one must talk bold jocular small talk for hours with the servants to ward off hysteria next morning tuesday january the after effects of the raid were swept aside by barbara virginia i shant come on friday because im going to be married youre going to marry yes nick and saxon saxon doesnt mind nothings to be changed were all agreed these are the terms i dont myself think that she wishes to be married but has convinced herself that she should moreover the horror of nicks return in a month keeps her graver than otherwise she showed no wish to be congratulated or in any way fussed over she stayed printed as usual and expecting a raid we asked her to sleep this time it began at the warning at least it was far louder this time an aeroplane went over the house about soon after the guns were so near that i didnt like to fetch a pair of shoes left in the bedroom we had arranged mattresses in the kitchen after the first noise slackened we lay all together l on the kitchen table like a picture of slum life one thud came very near but in an hour we had the bugles went up to bed the thud wh l distinguished from the rest came from the explosion of bombs at kew nine people i think killed servants became plaintive lottie began talking of the effect upon her head they hint that we ought to leave london wednesday january up to a concert tea with ottoline she is perched in the smallest bedroom of a bloomsbury hotel moulting depressed untidy overdressed not much talk of interest to me though friendly not so overpowering in certain directions as usual thursday january a deep fog all day we both set type dipping out to buy a bun for tea was as much of that air as we wanted i remembered how glad we were first of the fog second of being alone for barbara slept at hampstead friday february a day of fog in patches last night the worst fog they say for years old gents who escaped the raid walked in numbers over the edge of platforms were crushed a cook stepped into the thames people walked by rapping our railings to keep the road l went to london coming home at reported a starry night clear afternoon the fog deep once more when night fell here saturday february the first walk weve had for ever so long damp mild vaporous day funeral bells tolling as we went out marriage as we came in the streets lined with people waiting their meat aeroplanes droning invisible our usual evening alone happily knee deep in papers sunday february sunday has become as it used to be in hyde pk gate the social day the sociability began early for l at least riddell the printer unidentified coming as we hoped to offer a press but as we discovered only to say that presses arent to be had a female friend was with him i listened behind the bathroom door we found goldie when we came in from our walk then pippa came curiously untidy as all strachey women become at the least provocation without a certain degree of good looks it isnt worth being vainthats their reasoning i always suppose the talk was hampered by the suspicion that she was a jingo secondly an older fashioned type then were used to she has the disconcerting though worthy habit of remaining quite silent when she disagrees she disagreed with me when i said i thought cooperative housekeeping implying beds was an improvement on the old style goldie shot his direct well pointed arrows my only criticism in his case is the feeling which his method produces of being a method they dig for views too cleverly these elderly donsstillstill pippa has faded curiously looks older more worn she spoke of old days of parties h b smith george duckworth jack hills christmases at corby she thinks that still the way to live those people so civilised compared with our cropheads but now she has no time for society does suffrage which will turn now into a campaign for equality by day night mercifully she said there are people like you who keep out of it its most important that there should be people like you that is so long as youve got or earned economic independence thats essential no im not clever ive always cared more for people than for ideas now i must go ive got work to do i mustnt be lured into sloth here so she went it struck me that age consists not in having a different point of view but in having the same point of view faded goldie shows this too an evening alone monday february up to the times with a coleridge article once more i lost myself owing partly to the multiplicity of water lanes met l at the club where people for once had agreed to silence solitary reading of books so we were left to ourselves we have started a bottle of saccharine so save our sugar tuesday february karin came to give her lecture she arrived at tea time i cant help being reminded by her of one of our lost dogstinker most of all she fairly races round a room snuffs the corners of the chairs tables wags her tail as hard as she can snatches at any scrap of talk as if she were sharp set she eats a great deal of food too like a dog this extreme energy may be connected with deafness she has become a bolshevik she has offered her services to the labour party hopes theyll send her up down england organising constituencies since shes tired of reading writingnever did much like it now scents a scrimmage wants to be in the thick of it socialism is nibbling at our friends in a curious way she adrian have scruples about the size of their income wish to earn money partly because half their income depends on mrs b she gave her paper on league of nations well though speaking too quick the difference that education makes is very marked though i think they took her points i was surprised to hear that she was much relieved when it was done she stayed the night the next morning which with a fitness of simile now to be explained costs me a tooth to lose moreover she sits over the fire i have to shout but i see that adrian must find her energy her not fastidious or critical but generous warm blooded mind her honesty stability a great standby l w notes that on wednesday afternoon february he went with vw to see dr craig who said that her weight was too low for safety she then had a tooth extracted by harrison under gas next day they dined with maynard keynes at gordon square to meet elizabeth asquith who did not come molly maccarthy and duncan grant did on friday vw had influenza and dr fergusson was sent for they went to asheham on february until l march there are no entries in the asheham diary for this period saturday march what is the use of finishing a sentence left unfinished a month ago here we are evening i came back from asheham or rather charleston an hour ago after karin went that wednesday rather a monotonous time began for me influenza began on the friday i was kept in bed days on the next tuesday february we went to asheham my chief complaint is that i was divorced from my pen a whole current of life cut off secondly i saw no one for days i wasnt in a state for reading but i did finally read morley other books but reading when done to kill time has a kind of drudgy look in it i was asked to write a book in a seriesmakers ofthe th century but after deliberation refused nor did it at any moment seem possible but i write this down partly to give an official look to this diary partly because it marks a middle aged condition undoubtedly the country develops the spiritual side of life one day i sat in the garden reading shakespeare i remember the ecstasy every other day at least we had to walk to southease for milk we were only allowed one quart a dayd a quart the garden shows great promise l dug up the large bed transferred plants from the round middle bed to our path bed the buds visible on the trees sheep in the hurdles on the side of the down for of our io days we saw no one my letters even failed fairly completely but the days melted into each other like snowballs roasting in the sun on thursday february nessa came for the night i went back with her to charleston for friday night l taking the servants up to town henry moss had just arrived we all met for dinner for to my relief n i had tea alone in the drawing room moss mrs brereton give off a fairly strong atmosphere of the paid paying guest kind which is not pleasant mrs b an elderly upright firm unflinching woman whose integrity has been her chief capital in life she reminded me strongly of nurse reid she has the professional competence composure moss one might meetpractically anywhere he is a pale insignificant young man either very shy or very much out of his element we carried on as best we could entirely unhelped by him though mrs b spoke from a sense of duty she allowed nothing to blossom in her presence but dealt with each remark literally sensibly ann the daughter is much more charming than one might expect though no doubt marriage trials poverty have flattened out mrs bs charm prematurely she calls h moss her adopted son which sanctions their withdrawal after dinner to his bed sitting room where they are supposed to make up stories for the saturday westminster on saturday morning nessa duncan i sat in the studio gossiped part ofthe time we discussed art this is what i like doing best with them they say that theres no one worth considering as a painter in england todayno one like km or forster even with whom its worth discussing ones business in france this is reversed nessa showed me saxons letters he has made her his confidante he has been very unhappy made out his moments of exaltation depression with his usual minuteness in one he said that it was curious no longer to care for anything death being as desirable as life and then details about his healh we discussed also the peril of society which has to some extent washed off poor old desmonds bloom would submerge maynard if he were an artist i left at walking in a high wind with parcels slung across my shoulders to glynde through the park back here for tea met l buying the hanwell gazette i found a letter from saxona little cold i cant help thinking at least showing one after his letters to nessa that in this crisis im not his confidante its queer how one chooses one figure each time ones in a state for reasons not perceptible to the figure herself last winter i was to hear everything sunday j march a vile windy day sent off my conrad article at last printed a few labels for bunny but we stayed in were very happy monday march l took pages to the printer today to print off i being useless for this purpose went off to get into touch with london again which i did at the three usual pointsmudies london library seventeen club london from a spectacular point of view was at its worst like a middle aged char j woman with hair scrubbed off a bleak forehead in st james square a village of houses has been built to shelter some ministry i suppose it was strange to see how holes have been cut in the walls the roofs to allow the trees to stand undamaged some of the clerks will have a tree trunk to wipe their pens upon i found a silent group at the club all men unknown to me with the exception of alix who sat still as a statue greece and spent six months in india from until the war was ended he held a post in the red cross in alexandria all his novels except a passage to india had been published by reading one of berty russells books i interrupted though this is against my principles we had tea together her chief piece of news was that she saxon are going to set up together in faiths house after easter for the duration ofthe war months beyond it i fancy that they see something a little comic in this combination of the hopelessly enamoured indeed one cant help smiling rather at the thought of silences in which each will be thinking of someone else one fancies their common bond leading to a great deal of sympathetic collaboration but the plan is evidently a good one it recommended itself first to mrs bridgeman the housekeeper who thought two such quiet people should live together i did my best this time to keep low in tone serious k as far as possible sympathetic alixs feeling had been she said that i floated didnt mind how my prosperity reminded both her fredegond of all the things they lacked but why should f lack anything i left her sitting there as i believe she always sits till they turn out the lights or james comes to take her to dinner what will she be at home to find the two darkies perera and jayatilaka here l spent hours or so printing but did it in the end tuesday march another bitter day l up to a meeting at the club i spent the afternoon dissing ran out into the high street and was inveigled into the penny bazaar where the simplicity of shopping tempts one to spend the guild meets tonight for nick to address it wednesday march again one has to wonder why the women comewhat inducement there is in such a passive employment as sitting silent half asleep in a chair for an hour nick was in the right style for them too simple detailed casual much at his ease he spoke for an hour the thing that remains in my mind ofthe lecture is the waiting for trains the marching out with moon stars looking very cynical he said along perfectly straight roads lined with poplars his matter of fact way of speaking as if necessity must be bornehowever outrageous to his sense of decency common sense also struck me he seemed in good spirits proud of barbara telling us of her conquests which he believes in implicitly talking more than usual telling me how after the war theyd like to live in the country make good furniture after designs by carrington hes a human being of very good nature without special gifts to bend him this way or that the same is true of her i think its a rare production in our particular circle l to a meeting we now have a mania for gambling over demon patience i lost over this in a week impudent letter came from williams about ls book he is showing or means to show the doubtful passage to cooperators therefore cant start printing yet l now threatens to put the matter in the hands of his lawyers thursday j march in these days ive dissed pages in the hope that we may finish pages of the story before we go away again the raids seem so distant now that this precaution seems excessive the servants still sleep in the kitchen however as a shadow of moon remains philip came after lunch he l walked to kew i met them on the towing path he is obviously very wretched has no future wishes evidently save to get out to france he brought some of cecils poems which we have offered to print at once in a small book in our old type as giving him occupation it would be a good thing to do he offers to come help the more one sees of the effects on young men who should be happy the more one detests the whole thing philip takes more interest in the military side of it than nick i think he has refused an offer to work in london a bitter day our coal finished tomorrow the last raid dropped a bomb on the coal merchants friday march from yesterdays writing it looks as if the raids were casting their shadow before me were sent expressly by god to rebuke my arrogance however this may be we played our patience i lost my the only thought in our minds being i think something to do with patience or printing id taken my third final roll in bed when there was an explosion for half a minute a raid seemed so improbable that we made out it was one of the inexplicable outbursts of motor omnibuses however next minute the guns went off all round us we heard the whistles there was no denying it so we got our things together went to the kitchen this was at looking out we could only see stars yellowish in some sort of mist no moon but a still night as we lay down on our mattresses there was a great though distant explosion after that the guns set in very thick fast to north south never but once so near us as barnes at we had cocoa went to bed the bugles sounded at two hours from start to finish i shall never forget the ecstasy with which l burst into my room at breakfast the wretch williams has caved in he agrees to cancel the contract l was as triumphant as a fighting beast who has driven his enemy to skulk into the bushes i think he has reason to be for one thing it looked as though he could still worry impede for some months to come l might have been forced to arbitrate as it is the way is open instead of dealing with a surly unwilling spiteful mangy exasperating cur he can make his own termswhich hes doing this afternoon with allen unwin going up in the lift at holborn the other day i stood next a boy of or so whose head only was visible among the crowd i noticed that it was an extremely interesting sensitive clever observant head rather sharp but independent looking one couldnt tell from his cap whether he was well off or not i came to the conclusion that he was the son of an officer with whom he stood when we got into the street i looked at once at his legs his trousers had holes in them from that one could judge what a wretched affair his life will be i began setting up cecils poems this afternoon theyre not good they show the woolf tendency to denunciation without the vigour of my particular woolf i had all sorts of accidents only finished one saturday march l found unwin very ready to consider the cooperation book what is more unqualified in his abuse of williams who could he says be sued for the damage hes done to the books prospects he proposes to issue editionsone paper one cloth at once after that is reading the book which he means to do directly i daresay williams will still try to keep his paw upon the manuscript we went to a meeting called a suffrage rally in kingsway this afternoon it was a very fine afternoon through a glass door one could see the day lighta difficult light for speakers to speak down so prosaic reasonable unconcentrated the hall was fairly well filled the audience almost wholly women as the speakers were too the pure essence of either sex is a little disheartening moreover whether its a meeting of men or of women one cant help wondering why they do it i get one satisfactory thrill from the sense of multitude then become disillusioned finally bored unable to listen to a word in truth this meeting seemed to beat the waves in vain the vote being won only great eloquence could celebrate the triumph none were eloquent yet they had to beat up a froth the one who impressed us most was the russian speaker who had imagination seemed to feel what she said but at best large indisputable platitudes finely dressed balanced are the only things that can be put into speeches i watched mrs pethick lawrence rising falling on her toes as if half her legs were made of rubber throwing out her arms opening her hands thought very badly of this form of art we had tea at the club one room was crowded silent at the end of the other aldous huxley a young woman in grey velvet held what should have been a private conversation a has a deliberate rather dandified way of speaking all we learned virtuous people bent over our reforming papers in dead silence an occasional sentence of the muffled dialogue came out plain from the other end of the room now then they were discussing evan morgan his affairs of the heart i think we went on to the london library as we walked down the steep street someone came ambling crouching up to usbob tladen with an infinitely shabby baggy portmanteaufull of books i think so we went on together first he confided in l then in me at least he has the air of making a confidence or asking for one he wanted to know whether he could add my name to the list of devout jacobeans percy lubbock logan smith play this very characteristic game of exquisite interest of course to bob theyve counted bob was seriously exerting himself to find a st but i refusedwith some vehemence at first thinking i was to be asked to subscribe to a memorial nothing so substantial only an elderly cultivated game monday march i spent on books this afternoon a fact to be recorded since its the only mention of buying books this year or last perhaps as a matter of fact ive accumulated as times money add for a birthday present i have an unparalleled gain first however i beat the town for chocolate or sweets in the whole of the stores not one ounce of choc to be had but some simple square drops such as one used to buy in a bag for a penny haifa crown will now buy a pound of them half a crown in old days would have bought a coalscuttle full then i went on the top of a bus for the day was ofthe quality of june only fresher sadder too to nutts shop to get a leopardi then to mudies where i bought mill on liberty then to the charing cross road where i bought the happy hypocrite by max beerbohm k exiles of the snow by lancelot hogben in this way i laid out but i was amused to find that the lust after books revives with the least encouragement i want a copy of congreve i could have had one containing all the plays i shall ever read for i daresay but this demon suggested that i might enquire for the baskerville in two volumes the bookseller shared my lust which increased it in short i told him to make enquiries he would not commit himself to name any probable price from which i judge that he is calculating on the lust to possess it when i see it and after all nothing gives back more for ones money than a beautiful bookobviously im slipping i sauntered round his shelves as i had done in most of the shops he is careful select bookish no bargains but the type of book one might like to buy these bookshops have an air ofthe th century people drop in gossip about literature with the shopkeeper who in this case knew as much about books as they did i overheard a long conversation with a parson who had discovered a shop in paddington full of elzevirs he denounced the government particularly for its waste of paper they should abolish all newspapers stick a sheet in the p office if there happened to be any news so to the club where i found l fredegond gerald shove goldie brailsford alix the poet hogben was also there i laid his little hook on the arm of my chair gossip of the usual kind poor hogbens book is precisely the dreary imitative stuff one might have expected or even worse than one might have expectedwhat lytton would call illiterate under the influence of swinburne incredibly ungifted weakly rebellious home l to a l of n meeting tuesday march this page should be wholly devoted to praise of the weather one curious effect of spring in the suburbs is that it produces an astonishing amount of male female singing in the evening we sit with open windows a lady warbles out notes in apparent ecstasy she may be forgiven though considering here are some facts i sat by choice on a seat in the shade at kew i saw two heath butterflies willows crocuses squills all in bud blossom black clothes look like dusty palls as for fur it makes one laugh we met at kew i may say that im rejected by the times to rub this sore point sorer l has books from the nation its the second week of my rejection it has the result of making me write my novel at an astonishing rate if i continue dismissed i shall finish within a month or two it becomes very absorbing we both notice that lately weve written at a terrific pace l words as yet hasnt touched the book itself im well past thursday march if id written this diary last night which i was too excited to do i should have left a row of question marks at the end what excited me was the evening paper after printing all the afternoon i went out later bought a star looked at it casually under the public house lamp read that the prime minister needed our prayers we were faced with momentous decisions we britons must cling together in a week or even a few days facts must be faced which would change the british empire for ever we evolved from this an offer of peace to france but it appears to be only lgs way of whipping up his gallery anyhow i was whipped gerald who was to have dined rang up to say that a raid was expected he must stand by the night was cloudy we werent much alarmed partly because the warning came from official sources my dismissal is revoked a large book on pepys arrived which i spent the evening reading now another on swinburne awaits me at the railway station im divided whether one likes to have books or to write fiction without interruption but i may make a few shillings to pay for my baskerville friday march happily the weather is turned cloudy spring blotted out but one must sacrifice spring to the war philip came we printedi making rather a mess ofthe poems to my annoyance philip talked about blimey who is a shepherd near the quantocks monday march i wrote the date then something interrupted mea letter i think to lytton giving reasons for not reviewing his book today is wednesday this the first moment ive had for writing after tea on saturday the chatter began lytton carrington came to teashe apple red firm in the cheeks bright green yellow in the body immensely firm large all over the talk has run off my mind so that i dont suppose there was anything said of great importance theyd been at barbaras party till the next morning fredegond nessa kept it off the rocks by giving an imitation of ottoline nick saxon both gloomy in the background carrington going out of the room for a second lytton explained that he would like to stay with us without her could it be managed he asked me to review his book i agreed without thinking on second thoughts i dont much want to write under surveillance or to ask bruce richmond for what he must know to be the book ofa friend on sunday the burden of visitors was oppressive the list speaks for itself gerald duckworth saxon lunch saxon tea barbara nick middleton murry dinner geralds likeness to a pampered overfed pug dog has much increased his hair is white there is hardly a gleam of life let alone intelligence in his eye the feebleness of his hold on life save through the stomach must be fearful he has no opinions but merely a seaweeds drift in the prevailing current his commercial view of every possible subject depressed me especially when i thought of my novel destined to be pawed snored over by him but the odd thing was that he had nothing to say this took till perhaps saxon at his least urbane most insignificant its melancholy that misfortune should be unbecoming but im afraid in his case it is his complexion suffers his mind seems frost bitten he was beaten at chess went as if not wishing to meet n b nick was the only cheerful one of us poor murry snarled scowled with the misery of his lot he works all day writes when he comes home worst of all km has been very ill with haemorrhage from the lungs out in france has to be brought home wh is difficult in order to see how bad she is but i thought him very much more of a person a brain than i had thought him before i think this was partly due to the contrast with nick the difference between a good mind a mediocre one is very sharp not that m is as easy or as agreeable but he works his brains always has worked them thus cuts his way through a different atmosphere i had a good deal of talk about books with him such as one couldnt have with nickthough hes read jane austen can keep his end up by natural good sense taste b was almost blotted out scarcely spoke i think they went first we said goodbye the modern method of covering all obviously emotional crises with a varnish of prose common sense makes such partings almost ostentatiously matter of fact murry stayed on for a time discussing french writers thomas hardy he will never write another novel he says poetry is a short cut life seems to me now very precarious on monday z march i stayed here did my compositors work l to london on tuesday we had tea at the club meeting all the usual people save that bryns a rarity went to a general meeting where l was elected th on the committee then on to dine with ka arnold forster the other guest much to my surprise the first person to come in afterwards was hilton young i dont think ive said words to him since when we had that interview ive always guessed that dark dealings on the part of oh intervened at anyrate we broke completely this knowledge made me at least uncomfortable but we are elderly now he a perfect type of naval officer cleanshaven shorn red faced all blue cloth gold braid with a ribbon on his breast his dark enigmatic ways the sphinx without a secret are swept away yet i liked himthought him kind trusty a little romanticim afraid no longer romantic about me but how even begin to guess anothers feelings i found myself pitying him for the very first time i suppose hes more than after all he wished for something which hes done without we talked hard indeed he finds no romance in the navy after four years we wondered about our vision of england not knowing his degree of pugnacity talk was difficult save on general subjects the shoves came a brisk friend of kas out of an office i think as we left little waf very humble very small very innocent as he used to be wednesday march we printedbut just missed getting it done on thursday march the woolfs went to asheham and vw reopened her asheham diary to recall that they had come therefor ten days in february after her influenza now on their easter visit her usual observations of local weather natural phenomena prices and their own movements are recorded on march duncan grant came to lunch and l w returned with him to charleston the war news on march was very bad but better next day lytton strachey came to stay on march but barbara bagenal failed to arrive lytton was sick and stayed in bed all day on march on april james strachey and noel olivier came the following day lytton removed to charleston on april the woolfs returned to richmond leaving james and noel to stay on at asheham and vw reverts to diary iv friday april i think that wednesday was broken off short as they always tend to be on the verge ofa move so far as i remember it snowed hailed thundered people off we went to asheham on thursday in such a burst of summer heat that people in the tube pulled blinds down the uproar potency what word will express the stir of life still cased in a soft velvet sheath of richmond worshipping a tank was like the hum of bees round some first blossom we had the bee k the blossom in no metaphorical sense at asheham once more my memory is most centred upon an afternoon reading in the garden i happened to read wordsworth the poem which ends what man has made of man the daffodils were out the guns i suppose could be heard from the downs even to me who have no a immediate stake repudiate the importance of what is being done there i was an odd pallor in those particular days of sunshine theres always a sadness in spring of course our visitors broke in upon the moods which weave so thick a texture into life alone at asheham first lytton then we waited with eyes upon the avenue for the appearance of barbara she never came though upon sunday i had a letter telling the almost incredible story of her repeated attempts to get into a train how for three days she went to victoria sometimes was kept outside the barrier sometimes was stuck opposite the gap between the carriages never got in finally spent easter alone in her studio expecting so we are told to find herself in some months short of a fortnight the mother of a child lytton was with us one day less than a week our chief exercise was along the road to beddingham we had short to me very intimate talks intimate in the sense that he will understand from the sight of the tail what i the whole body of the thought is in ones mind these thoughts were for i the most part about books but books include a good deal of lifei suspect that he is now inclined to question whether eminent victorians in number requiring years for their production are quite enough to show for his age pretensions at anyrate he was evidently rather painfully anxious about our opinion of their merits came back so often though so tactfully to the question of my review that i hesitate i suppose the contrast to me there is a contrast between his achievements ls achievements made itself felt to him then he was sick one morning green sickness lottie described it with her usual passion enthusiasm for painting all colours at their brightest his ebb of health is very low certainly health does make one careful perhaps a little peevish spiritually i remarked whether the result of bad health or not a distinct increase in his family pride it has now reached almost a religious pitch a bad sign like patriotism it means that certain feelings are to grow large lusty under shelter for instance james must be exalted as a man of iron will superb administrator c but the light is shed on each one of the family even upon cousins like mary h i rather resent it then james noel came our patience wore rather thin visitors do tend to chafe one though impeccable as friends im always glad at the end of a visit to find ones liking unmodified as it was in all three casesyet im puzzled to account for the sense of strain discomfort which the people one likes most manage to produce l i discussed this he says that with people in the house his hours of positive pleasure are reduced to one he has i forget how many hours of negative pleasure a respectable margin of the acutely unpleasant are we growing old are our habits setting in like the trade winds but this time the food difficulties certainly increased ones discomfort one day we came back from a long walk to find the third of a loaf of bread on the table no more to be had in the house this was due to bad management on nellys part but then at asheham its very easy to manage badly needs considerable thought cycling carrying to manage even tolerably at one point the servants wrought themselves into the usual row the relief of being back in comparative plenty anyhow next door to shops is quite recognisable we came up on friday went straight to lunch at cliffords inn dived into partridge cooper then i came home and l went to see bonwick the result of seeing bonwick is what i foretold see page they have offered him the editorship of the new review indeed make his acceptance a condition of starting it which they propose to do at once some arrangements must be come to with wright but they will solve themselves i suspect l has io days in which to decide theres the question of staff of salary so on if he accepts he will be able to give up feeding the omnivorous callous throated eagle with reviews considering the merits of that cheap thin blooded creature i speak of his journalism his methods of running the paper his lack of power judgment competence i shall consider l wise to take the other job merely as a means of escape but in itself too it might be not a means but an end thus we had rather a sanguine happy sort of return considering how disappointing returns generally are saturday april this morning i had a letter from barbara telling me that nick was dangerously wounded on the th the wound is in the back kidneys k they have operated the last news said he was well through the operation they have heard no more if he recovers perhaps he wont be sent out againbut who knows at least she has had the blow soon k if it were me i should think that a blessing in itself but the state of waiting for telegrams k letters without any certainty when theyll come k this baby in prospect must be as fair a combination of torture as human beings can invent for each other however saxon is moving house she helps him his voice on the telephone sounded as if pleasure of some sort had not entirely deserted him but when a crisis happens scarcely anyone meets it naturally either theyre too composed k prosaic or the other extreme saxon has a curious cul de sac of his own rain all day till this moment when it has turned brilliant plum in blossom in the garden k flowers very healthy looking to turn over books in hiskokes i bought collins poems k colley cibbers autobiography both together l to staines floras husband has just gone abroad sunday april we are just back from tea with barbara k saxon in the studio nick is already moved to another hospital k has written himself so at least he must be in no immediate danger indeed they think he may be home any day now we had tea saxon in his brown woollen vest stepping fantasti cally about the room to lay the table barbara so evidently nervous that i suppose the child must be a factbut that days waiting for news can try anyones nerves the couple in the interior were almost too perfect an illustration of the post impressionist spirit for my taste even the black white cat seemed decorated by the omega white wash in which the hairs of the brush remain a striped pole burnet for the covers china dogs for the mantelpiece check cottons wherever you looked to the censorious eye one or two uncertainties of taste or reversions to an earlier stage as for example a bead necklace hanging on a nail however i came back to think my own room very ugly the talk was sober adequate but not profuse i dont think saxon who had just washed his head had anything to say his demeanour is a little tart gritty at the moment he reminded me ofa hen who has laid an eggbut only one we did not like hampstead the vulgarity of richmond is always a relief afterwards monday april there is an awkward moment between coming back from london dinner which is the salvation of this book for some reason one cant settle to read yet writing seems the proper channel for the unsettled irritable condition one is generally in perhaps this condition is intensified by tea at the club particularly if one happens to meet roger in the charing cross road in his wideawake hat with four or five yellow french books under his arm he is the centre ofa whirlwind to me under this influence i was blown straight into a book shop persuaded to lay out on a french novel et cie by a jew made to fix a day for coming to durbins invited to a play fairly overwhelmedmade to bristle all over with ideas questions possibilities which couldnt develope in the charing cross rd of course he was in a hurry to keep an appointment at the burlington to produce one or two plays somewhere elseill too so he said but somewhat relieved in his mind by reading fabre who makes him see that after all our war hideous though it isbut here we parted i ran in to a kind of backwater of roger at the club goldie miss dudley at least mrs manus langdon davies l cant be included under that heading we sat in the groundfloor room k poor old goldie wrinkled his forehead flung himself lightly ardently into one question after another in his usual waythe way ofa bachelor who lives by plying his mind moving by that means from person to person having no settled abode a sort of gipsy or vagrant he mourned all the deaths of the young meneric whitehead the last to be killed said that he would fight if young enough as it is he sits on committees i left them to conduct another committee went to poland st to get my watch on the way i walked through a narrow street lined on both sides with barrows where stockings ironmongery candles k fish were being sold a barrel organ played in the middle i bought bundles of coloured tapers the stir k colour k cheapness pleased me to the depths of my heart but i couldnt pay for my watch owing to the seductive magic of roger in the charing x road k so had to leave it ticking away like a young watch home by victoria a sunny evening swarming with people tuesday april this is most curious weather also most unpleasant rain descends at intervals from a dark grey sky even when it isnt raining the sky is still grey its warm damp k the young leaves have a lurid look in die winter atmosphere the green is as if seen at night by electric lights we quarrelled yesterday about my jug of cream k l was unreasonable k i was generous the quarrel ended at sharp at miss mattaei arrived i remember her at newnham she has left we understand under a cloud it is easy to see from her limp apologetic attitude that the cloud has sapped her powers of resistance we skirted round the war but she edged away from it it seemed altogether odious that anyone should be afraid to declare her opinionsas if a dog used to excessive beating dreaded even the raising of a hand she l discussed their business which has to do with war peace may result in an offer to her of a place on the staff she has to earn her living i must tell you one thing she said when the talk was over my father was a german i find it makes a good deal of differenceit is a distinct hindrance commercially l agreed that it was she is a lanky gawky unattractive woman about with a complexion that blotches red shiny suddenly dressed in her best which was inconceivably stiff ugly but she has a quick mind is an enthusiast said she loved writing wednesday io april averywet dark day printed i set up one page in houri minutes my record at this rate the book might be done in a month i had a letter from miss harriet weaver yesterday asking whether we would consider printing joyces new novel which no other printer will do owing presumably to its sentiments they must be very warm considering the success he had with his last she is to come here though we can hardly tackle a book like this dipping into the great bran pie by the way im rejected by the times once more thus reel off my book at a great pace i suppose books will flood in all in a heap one of these days to the printer who has almost set up his new machine but without power without a compositor we are still far from getting our rights thursday april to the club this afternoon but one must describe the weather imagine living inside a yellow balloon the ceiling of which floats up down with an atmosphere inside of exhausted air such is our situation when the ceiling sinks nearly to the top of our heads we have to turn on the electric light as we did at luncheon occasionally rain falls but brings no relief going to london all the lights in the train were on i went to the omega got my pictures ran into roger carrying a roll of manu script which was he said his translation of the lysistrata this he has done on a moderate knowledge of greek wishes to have acted but doubts how far one can go i carried the pictures all the way to gerrard street stopping at poland street to pay get my old gold watch whose distinction dignity are very marked after months of ingersoll at the club i foundneed i repeat that old scene once more i think the change from toast to roll honey interested me more than the fragments of scurr cousins marshall or than the pale constrained solemnity of poor alix having robbed her of a fortnight with james i felt rather guilty l came in from the natives meeting he is going up again to a farewell party to bertie at mrs hamiltons last night he went for less than minutes to a labour party meeting saturday april ls farewell party was freely sprinkled with our nonconforming friends i dont know why their virtues in combination are so depressing there was dora adrian karin she announces that she is with child burns alix so on bertie broken down safe to be imprisoned either for his article or for his conscience the new bill rakes in all the elder generations all their consciences are now being racked but so far they seem inclined to stop short of prison friday was a pleasant day the sun out the blossom leaves of a natural colour we spent the afternoon printing it was the first evening we had alone for a long time sunk deep in our chairs we were interrupted in our books by walter lamb upon review of the conversation we agreed that he was slightly above his usual level he told long stories of his walk in a snowstorm with every detail given a prominence more interesting to him than to us the wildest romance would be flattened however by that voice lord canterbury is again to the fore he is a persian scholar has given w the arabian nights he lives in a house which is not fashionable enough to do him justice he has an italian footman who secures meat from a friend in any quantity a small loin of lamb was left at ws door the other morning he expects to fall again before the temptation he has given up reading finding no time for it but examines boys in the classics told us stories about j j thompson whose mother keeps a small shop where watty used to buy sweets as a boy so we slipped on w sitting between us l yawning without concealment i yawning with an attempt at concealment the academy is storing its precious pictures only in number in some tube they are told to expect immense bombs at the end of the month which will dig feet deep then explode today saturday we printed finished pages as we only began on tuesday we have done a record a cold dismal day very bad news in the newspapers stout redfaced elderly men are visibly perturbed and ireland has conscription if one didnt feel that politics are an elaborate game got up to keep a pack of men trained for that sport in conditionone might be dismal one sometimes is dismal sometimes i try to worry out what some of the phrases were ruled by mean i doubt whether most people even do that liberty for instance last night desmond rang us up im afraid our friends motives wont stand scrutiny his book comes out on monday he though forgetting everything yet remembers a vague joking promise of mine uttered at least a year ago to review it in the times he is sending me a copy he wants to stay here im now debating how to deal with these damned authors thursday april there is a grave defect in the scheme of this book which decrees that it must be written after tea when people come to tea i cant say to them now wait a minute while i write an account of you they go its too late to begin and thus at the very time that im brewing thoughts i descriptions meant for this page i have the heartbreaking sensation that the page isnt there theyre spilt upon the floor indeed its difficult to mop them up again and at this moment the mere length of my list of unrecorded visitors frights me from beginning judge wadhams hamilton holt harriet weaver ka roger nessa maynard shepherd goldie not to mention the guild alix bryn noel who may be called the club all these have accumulated since sunday each deserves something to mark their place i did mark it at the time but how recover the impression of wadhams holt it was a tremendously successful visit on sunday april we had prepared ourselves most accurately they made speeches looked at the pictures complimented l all according to forecast they were impressive to me in the first place for their vivacity which combined with their large well nourished bodies made them appear powerful next because they treated me with respect then because they were simply intensely in love with the league of nations judge wadhams had spotted every minister in america they were in touch with every group of people in the world as far as i could gather with an army of stenographers who send out pamphlets with the personal touch wherever a pamphlet can lodge compared with this our record is tame we put you right on the top mr woolf ofthe constructive thinkers of the wari can see your place on my shelves at this moment pardon me you have used the word social more than once i dont rightly understand what you mean by it we both explained for io minutes no i dont understand well we must proceed to the sidney webbs but weve done no more than scratch your surface mr woolf we must try to do more next time with thanks to you mrs woolf for letting us see your home off they went but almost instantly harriet weaver appeared here our predictions were entirely at fault i did my best to make her reveal herself in spite of her appearance all that the editress of the egoist ought to be but she remained inalterably modest judicious decorous her neat mauve suit fitted both soul body her grey gloves laid straight by her plate symbolised domestic rectitude her table manners were those ofa well bred hen we could get no talk to go possibly the poor woman was impeded by her sense that what she had in the brownpaper parcel was quite out of keeping with her own contents but then how did she ever come in contact with joyce the rest why does their filth seek exit from her mouth heaven knows she is incompetent from the business point of view was uncertain what arrangements to make we both looked at the ms which seems to be an attempt to push the bounds of expression further on but still all in the same direction and so she went and ka came was made to drink castor oil out of an egg cup lay on a sofa was nearly sick had a disturbed night k was better next morning then i went to guildford i dont see how to put or hours of rogers conversation into the rest of this page i must stop k read viola meynell it was about all manner of things on growing old on loneliness on religion on morality on nessa on duncan on french literature on education on jews on marriage k on the lysistrata occasionally he read a quotation from a book by proust whose name ive forgotten k then from his translation of the lysistrata k we woke next morning to find the hills covered in snow k came up in a bitter wind k rain to the omega so to gordon sqre where first the new delacroix k then the cezanne were produced there are apples in the cezanne picture what can apples not be i began to wonder theres their relationship to each other k their colour k their solidity to roger k nessa moreover it was a far more intricate question than this it was a question of pure paint or mixed if pure which colour emerald or veridian k then the laying on of the paint k the time hed spent k how hed altered it k why k when hed painted it we carried it into the next room k lord how it showed up the pictures there as if you put a real stone among sham ones the canvas of the others seemed scraped with a thin layer of rather cheap paint the apples positively got redder k rounder k greener i suspect some very mysterious quality of potation in that picture all day it rained k l was out to tea k brought goldie home to dinner goldie was humiliated by the fall of bailleul but told his neat well groomed stories k i went to the guild which pleased me by its good sense k the evidence that it does somehow stand for something real to these women in spite of their solemn passivity they have a deeply hidden k inarticulate desire for something beyond the daily life i believe they relish all the pomp of officers k elections because in some way it symbolises this other thing they recanted their abuse of the woman on syphilis which i think to their credit since then they have learnt they said that she only spoke the truth they wish me to get them a speaker on sex education mrs hiscoke telling us that she had had to get a friend to explain the period to her own daughter k she still feels shy if the daughter is in the room when sexual subjects are discussed shes years old on wednesday april l went to lunch with rowntree k accomplished another stage ofhis progress to the editors chair a dummy copy is to be prepared r still hedges on the question of expense but remarked all the same thou art the man ls hand shook so that he had no luncheon this came entirely of discussing the question before he went up i went to caslons k sat in that solid impressive room among the empty desks k smooth tables while they went to fetch me worth of hs lower case k the printer of the bank of england ordered lbs of type to be conveyed at once in a van the weight being beyond the capacity ofa taxi find immense satisfaction in hearing the talk of these solid competent business men who give their orders with such weight k simplicity k never a word wasted k such character of a plain sort in every movement k feature to tea at the club k alix k bryn k noel there k i rather disliked them all on thursday we took a little walk but in the teeth of such wind that there was little pleasure in it then l had to dine with margaret he is becoming almost a diner out but in our circle this is a matter more of business than of pleasure one goes either to meet someone or to settle something or to say goodbye to a prisoner berties case still hangs fire however today i got desmonds book sent im sorry to say by request of the author richmond when i asked for ds lyttons books said certainlyif you can keep it secret i couldnt promise to do this therefore wrote to tell him not to send them and now i must inform desmond lytton they wont suffer really i believe but they will be anxious instead of safe im in two minds as to whether im glad or sorry i think i could have said some very clever things a few true things but undoubtedly one cant avoid a certain uneasiness in writing formally of people one knows so well friday april a day of gigantic effort for l eight pages printed it off he went at is still pm at the printers standing in the cellar slipping page after page between the pins having had only a short time off for tea by tonight i shall have pages to diss then to set up though the type runs to pages lines with the new hs t being the one to give out at last snow storms of wind bitter cold occasional sunshine sunday april how many poor people clergymen retired officers for the most part must be tapping the glass looking gloomily at their lawns covered with withered blossomwithered still half closed then blown off the twig orchards must be ruined by this time at kew yesterday the magnolias were a most melancholy sight the great pinkish buds just ready to burst into the most magnificent of flowers now browned shrivelled never to open while they live to be ugly we noticed several branches ending in white gloves according to l a sign that some experiment in grafting is being tried even the daffodils are all blown crooked fruit trees brown nipped the weather goes on with its wind rain occasional snow i went to a concert at the palladium this afternoon but on the whole i regretted it a man called julian clifford played mozart as if it were a dream waltz slowly sentimentally with a kind of lugubrious stickiness which spoilt my pleasure in the g minor l to staines i must now write to desmond who has been telephoning i fear with thoughts of that review friday april there are five or six days missed outi dont remember why but partly at least because there wasnt much to say on monday april i remember having tea at the club meeting fredegond ermengard a lady farmer someone i took to be bryn but she answered to the name of daphne the shoves are driven to the land again had left it to the very last moment of course being under compact to have a job by monday were still in doubt whether to try cambridge hertford or hampshire i talked mainly to ermengarda rare visitor but somehow familiar as l remarked these country women get a slow bovine manner rather refreshing to my taste she breeds prize bulls plays a double bass in the evening writes improper stories for children she seems to have settled into a corner absolutely fitted for her where she exists pleasantly having a quaker faith now to round her off i got the impression of some large garden flower comfortably shoving its roots about well planted in the soilsay a stock or a hollyhock on tuesday april wright dined slept here i listened with respect to a long conversation in which both l he played their parts with perfect knowledge of the rules of the game such was the impression that their deliberate easy yet concise manner of speech made upon me how far w minded his fate it was difficult to say the rules ofthe game require complete urbanity he was extremely nice to play so well of course he offered to help as much as he could his opinion of his own powers as editor being naturally higher than ours or indeed than the trustees this was very nice of him but i expect theres truth in his own saying that hed rather get what he wants done by others than do it himself he labours under a variety of diseases is very deliberate taking twice the time to finish a meal that we do perhaps times as long to finish a sentence the question of salaries was discussed w thinks this will be referred to him he suggests from to for miss matthaei between for l this is more than we expected however it depends on more people than wright eagle here rings up to say hes standing for parliamenta labour candidate at that rate the manx cat has a chance on wednesday april lottie spilt half a case of type on the floor so that i had to spend hours in sorting every compartmentabout the most trying work there is she had mixed the letters in thoroughly thinking or hoping that though divided in compartments the letters were all the same on thursday i was recumbent l went to do proofs at the office on friday we set up took a short walk the weather varies between fog sunshine saving us at least from raids though the moon is full wednesday may theres a fate in saying that were safe from raids on friday april i went to the hippodrome to see life l seeing a different variety of it at the club tne incredible pathetic stupidity of the music hall for surely we could have risen higher only politeness made us laugh almost made me uncomfortable but the humour of harry tate though a low grade was still the queer english humour something natural to the race which makes us all laugh why i dont know k you cant help feeling its the real thing as in athens one might have felt that poetry was home about at the usual maroons even extra whistling the fine night made this likely we bundled our bedding into the kitchen took up our appointed stations l and i lying by the grate n lottie whispering in the cellar after minutes i thought i heard bugles ones ears can imagine so much that i said nothing ten minutes later nelly burst out the bugles so they were we went upstairs inclined to blame some clerk whose ears played him tricks which the night made into certainties but desmond tells us that american aeroplanes crossing the coast without giving the signal caused the false alarm which woke the whole of london though ignored by the press on saturday april we went to hampton court the first visit for a long time but this weather i am unjust though saturday was fine we had a tremendous talk about the equator in the middle of a demonstration with two pebbles jack radcliffe passed or so i thought this diverted my attention a serious reprimand had to be administered it was discovered that i took the equator to be a circular mark coloured dull red upon the end of a football the ignorance inattention combined displayed in this remark seemed so crass that for about minutes we couldnt speak however i was forgiven told about the tropics of cancer capricorn the question originally was about the time of moon k sun rise k setting in different months on sunday april desmond came to dinner that is after dinner he has the hard sea worthy look of an old salt cased in stiff black with a few gold scrolls about him k boots made out of plain leather but within this shell he is as tender k vague as ever k very tired after his days work which results he is alarmed to find k so are we in practical action upon his evidence his mind had a factitious spryness about it as if still working under the official eye but this wore off k he yawned k couldnt stir himself up though ls yawns were partly the cause of his late at night he took to reading joyces ms aloud k in particular to imitating his modern imitation of a cats miau but l went to bed k though capable of spending a night in this manner i had compunction k decoyed desmond upstairs collecting books as we went next morning having observed that breakfast at would possibly be early enough he stayed talking about books till k rambled off quite out of tune for his office l dined with the webbs at this point it would be useful could i command the pen of some intelligent k well informed diarist with an eye for the future someone who could put down what were the really interesting things that sir wm tyrrell camile huysman k the sidney webbs said in lws hand went to dine at webbs camille huysmans k sir william tyrrell there the latter is now head of commercial intelligence dept k is engaged on drawing up complete dossier of our terms for the peace conference a small round grey friendly man more like a wellmannered literary manif there be suchthan a diplomatist very frankostensiblyk talked incessantly of policies k people a friend of mine was at kiel on the day ofthe murder ofthe arch duke k saw the kaiser immediately after he had heard the news the k said es ist ein verbrechen gegen das germantum when i heard that i knew it meant war lichnowsky has a poor mind he is a sort of village idiot his polish blood however gives him a kind of intuition so that he sees further sometimes than cleverer men the intuition of the village idiot the only hope he said was for the allies definitely to declare themselves for a league of nations define its constitution we should be surprised if the german offensive fails at the stiffness of the german terms even then wilson under certain circumstances will be the most immoveable of neverendians the most impertinent thing ever written was kuhlmanns answer to the pope a friend of mine met k k told him when he came to england to ask me what i thought of it i said tell k i think exactly what he thinks of it he said he had always thought that the greatest mistake the allies ever made was to refuse to allow our men to go to the stockholm conference on tuesday april i went to london in fact i went to the printers in farringdon street got wind ofa second hand press but how far this is the usual talk of shopkeepers i dont know on wednesday may ist we were to have printed off our pages were ready a th too w gave out this time but the printer has his magazine on the press wont be free till saturday these impediments are inevitable but jarring we were getting along so well on thursday we tried printing the title page on the small press nothing would make it come right the disease escaped us we had to give up in despairirritation at least all these days as black as november a high cold east wind friday may l to london to see henderson in course of seeing henderson he saw all the celebrities ofthe day webbs goldie so on i went to a registry office in the kings rd to get a servant for nessa the woman true chelsea marked as china is by her dress manner refinement she has a servant which is more to the point on then by bus tube to hampstead to tea with margaret i almost mistook lilian semirecumbent upon a green pillow for a persian cat janet was there in those decorous purple draperies with which people compromise between art fashion in hampstead margaret immensely fat broad all black she had stood two photographs of ottoline opposite my plate i felt this to be the heart of the womans republic l came in we had a long semipolitical argument arising out of milk combines about government margarets carpet is there to give an air of austerity to the room ah yes my lifes a compromiseall a compromise she said i was struck as usual by her genuine character also by the unadorned sense of lilian always to the point surprisingly ready with her views considering her air of modesty as a matter of fact i believe she comes at things better than most women being entirely unencumbered by any vanity as she may well be in clothing manner appearance she is of the most ordinary type possible thus her talk her pipe come with force janet shows signs of real old age acquiescent not blunted so much as increasingly meditativeshakes her head a little but she looked very well saturday may hodson came to lunch a soldier now though by profession a civil servant a hard straightforward man all about him seeming as close cropped as his head a man of average gifts i suppose thus a sample of what the world does to human beings he has no special gift or fortune to palliate life in this light i thought him rather sad so grim unpretending taking what comes as if it were anyhow good enough for him he didnt like the war but joined as a duty first the bachelors went then the married men then those who could afford to his passage cost him but there was no trace of heroism in this mere such is life he went to kew with leonard i to the printer who remains shut the first fine day since april ist or thereabouts hot blue sky no wind birds singing people swarming sunday may but when the wind turns to east it pours such a spring i cant remember though for blackness the summer i spent in bed at twickenham matched it according to nessa the country has the same climate this being so we walked out in our mackintoshes up the river down the avenue scarcely a couple to be seen i pitied the orange barrows half covered over with some wet man sheltering near under a tree his sunday sales demolished the tea gardens too look dishevelled with their daffodils bent drenched outside dysart house we heard a cuckoo inside some forlorn week end party was listening to a pianola desmond put us off i confess to our relief his mother burnt her face lighting a gas stove l was rather headachy perhaps owing to a swollen tooth monday may l was so uncomfortable this morning that we went out at eleven for it was sunny beautiful the wind being in the east we meant to sit in kew gardens but they dont open till therefore we sat on kew green which has been turned into allotment gardens ugly patches of raw earth spotted with white paper stuck into sticks at twelve we entered to the general loveliness freshness was added a sense of being out when we should have been at home this always turns things into a kind of spectacle it seems to be going on without you we sat under a tree became a centre for sparrows robins pestered by the attentions of a gigantic aeroplane l went to harrisons had his tooth out for it was very bad pouring poison into him sufficient to cause many headaches so harrison said i went to london on my usual round the one i like best in my beatific state i forgot the principle thing id gone for a typewriter ribbon but never mind that will be another days treat mudies i dont altogether like because im kept waiting but i love holborn the charing cross road i rather like turning into the club finding or expecting to find someone i want to talk to i dont like buying hats though though in july and august vw had spent six weeks in miss jean thomass private nursing home in twickenham which cared for patients with nervous disorders she was there again in die summer of but for little more than a fortnight ive conquered some part of the horror by learning how to look into the eyes of milliners make my demands boldly eighteen shillings for a hat seems a great price but i paid it it relieves me so much to have bought it that im happy again in the end but what womens faces in the streets as senseless as playing cards with tongues like adders i found james reading the antigone in the club presently leonard came with adrian adrian looks immensely long his little bow tie somehow gives him a frivolous rather than distinguished air as if a butterfly had settled on him by mistake he has some job in an office we gossiped blood is a very strong tie so much can be taken for granted after the first shyness then barbara came in in her round black hat with the cherry coloured ribbon as neat as if shed never been in france but all the same i think she is a little different nick is in hospital very irritable she spends her spare time with saxon i daresay the seesaw is not working quite smoothly but one cant honestly deduce this from a shadow round her eyes we went on to the london library so home tuesday may i write expecting philip morrell to dinnernot that one need dwell upon thatwind east violent rain grey sky again a letter from harry stephen suggesting a visit as if hed been in the habit of dropping in after dinner once a week all these years the ties of blood something very oddmoves in the stephen brain l tetter though not entirely right the tooth was an ancient mammoth i must read logans trivia now l has gone to a league of nations meeting at the house of commons ive had a rush of books as usual three tchekovs logan squire merrick hanging over me the woolfs were at asheham from to may no entries were made in the asheham diary tuesday may i he rush of books was disposed of squire was well drubbed too lt the same time such a rush of people coincided that i was clogged into complete dumbness i see buto take up the pen directly upon i coming back from asheham shows i hope that this book is now a natural growth of minea rather dishevelled rambling plant running a yard of green stalk for every flower the metaphor comes from asheham but first let me recall janet desmond katherine mansfield lilian there were othersyes there was harry stephen clive each left with me a page full of comments but useless now partly i think from my habit of telling these incidents over to people once told i dont want to retell them the telling leaves a groove in my mind which gives a hardness to the memory stereotypes it makes it a little dull but i wandered through richmond park in the moonlight with desmond we jumped a palisade into miss hickmans funeral grove found the dark green mounds pointed with red rosettes the rhododendron is a lovely flower for the moonlight and we beheld a china watercloset also lovely in the moonlight the divinity of a sheltered lodger wedged in among the ferns the flowering bushes desmond who has been pestering me with inscrutable persistence over the telephone in letters in visits to lunch with prince bibesco dropped all that drank a whole bottle bubbled like a tipsy nightingale amorous humorous reminiscent remembering the dead perhaps melancholy in a happy sort of way but he spoke rather pointedly of the charm intelligence of molly yes ive never feared tragedy in your lives i said nor does one though from what we hear they strain at the collar now then but modern life has the merit of allowing for that katherine was marmoreal as usual just married to murry liking to pretend it a matter of convenience she looks ghastly ill as usual we came to an oddly complete understanding my theory is that i get down to what is true rock in her through the numerous vapours pores which sicken or bewilder most of our friends its her love of writing i think but she is off to cornwall harry stephen told his old stories wrinkled his nose alluded several times to his great age he is an undoubted failure but that has a freshening effect upon people they are more irresponsible than the successes but yet one cant call harry exactly irresponsible either he is modest humorous all his pride for his father ancestors he still takes out an enormous pocket knife slowly half opens the blade shuts it janet was decidely more spirited than of late she discussed greek with l she is still puzzling out theories about plato very open minded ready to understand whatever one may spring on her i sprang first joyces novel then the murrys who are to be neighbours lilian read a paper to the guild in a thoroughly cooperative spirit i think i should take exception to their maternal care ofthe womens souls if i were connected with the movement but i see the terrible temptation of thinking oneself in the right wishing to guide influence then clive was in his best manoftheworld vein fresh from max beerbohm inclined to think himself one of our foremost he sent me his book where i find myself with hardy conrad nessa duncan bracketed first he babbled prattled hinted at all his friends parties interestsnot offensively to me at least he gives or wishes to give the impression that he sits drinking in the cafe royal with mary the young poets painters drift up he knows them all between them they settle the business his book is stout morality not very good criticism he seems to have little natural insight into literature roger declares that he doesnt know about pictures on the other hand he has the strong english sense of morality at asheham we had roger a picnic i spent a night at charleston that is by way of company but the important thing was the weather the heat was such that it was intolerable to walk before tea we sat in the garden i indolently reading l not sitting but gardening we had the best display of flowers yet seenwall flowers in profusion columbines phlox as we went huge scarlet poppies with purple stains in them the peonies even about to burst there was a nest of blackbirds against the wall last night at charleston i lay with my window open listening to a nightingale which beginning in the distance came very near the garden fishes splashed in the pond may in england is all they sayso teeming amorous creative i talked a good deal with nessamuch about servants other possibilities roger of course came up from bopeep k there was mrs bfrereton burnt brown solid stolid institutional very competent roger i croaked a kind of frogs chorus togetherhow we loved admired were only snubbed for our painsnessa sitting almost silent stitching a dress by lamplight roger is growing more egoistical or it is more apparent to me his complaints were more genuine than mine all interesting people are egoists perhaps but it is not in itself desirable there were numbers of belgian hares equal numbers of children to judge by the sound though they are kept to their own rooms hours by mrs b dont appear at all saxon barbara arrive at asheham as we gothis being our compromise for we didnt want them as visitors as they coolly enough proposed that we should have them thursday june these gaps are accounted for by the weather its not weather for drawing up to the fire settling in indeed i find some difficulty in reading the windows are both open the children next door are playing in the garden the usual song comes from the singing teachers room above the laundry the birds are vocal in the trees i want to be wandering down grassy spaces its impossible to concentrate things therefore pass unrecorded a good deal of sociability goes on in this weatheradrian karin dined with us on sunday she resolutely artistic in a distressing way bright green with sturdy embroidery let in they live rather apart from our world from all worlds i cant help feeling though this may be wrong a never troubles himself to see anyone together they make too dense a block to be good guests at a party a was amusing however prejudice leads me to think my own relations rather distinguished he certainly makes one laugh with his stories of saxon fifteen minutes it takes him to get from the recumbent to the sitting position a is observant malicious but more kindly than of old he has the taste she the energy ive seen alix tooindeed asked her back here to dine with me l being out i think the faintest ray of dawn is observable on the pitchy black of her horizon she is able to conceive the possibility of one day finding some book to read she has tried berties mathematics relinquished it but did not altogether dismiss my suggestion of legal history she wants to work at something that matters to no one k will never be used seen or read can be done for no more nor less than hours a day then carrington came to tea with me l making a speech again his activities are beyond counting nowwhat with league of nations all its evil designs war peace its possibilities to which one must add the persistent darkies the club committee carrington stayed over hours k i think that by itself is a sign of youth she is odd from her mixture of impulse k self consciousness i wonder sometimes what shes at so eager to please conciliatory restless k active i suppose the tug of lyttons influence deranges her spiritual balance a good deal she has still an immense strange admiration for him k us how far it is discriminating i dont know she looks at a picture as an artist looks at it she has taken over the strachey valuation of people k art but she is such a bustling eager creature so red k solid k at the same time inquisitive that one cant help liking her she posted me up in all the gossip jos has married his deaf governess k thereby blasted the hopes of heaven knows how many marjories she is dismissed in the harshest way humiliated in the face of all her friendsor so i should feel it lytton complains that the critics havent attacked his judgments they have copied each other k complimented him without much fineness still his book goes into another edition the praise from the elderly the ottolines k the goldies is lavish i havent yet read it through indeed ive rather shirked formulating my own opinion expecting to find it rather complicated at any rate as im on the verge of cooking dinner k going up to hear the magic flute i shant begin now and oliver has taken a new mistress k barbara k saxon have left asheham k i can think of no more gossip for the time being friday june one thing adrian said amused mehow it positively frightened him to see peoples faces on the heath like gorillas like orangoutangs perfectly inhumanfrightful k he poked his mouth out like an ape he attributes this to the warthough i can remember other pronouncements of the same kind before that perhaps the horrible sense of community which the war produces as if we all sat in a third class railway carriage together draws ones attention to the animal human being more closely l was told the other day that the raids are carried out by women womens bodies were found in the wrecked aeroplanes they are smaller k lighter k thus leave more room for bombs perhaps its sentimental but the thought seems to me to add a particular touch of horror i went to the magic flute k thought rather better of humanity for having that in them goldie was in the same row with me thinking i daresay much the same thoughts though the proximity of two youthful men may have coloured them differently there were roger pippa sheppard finally mary hutch jack alix jamesall collecting in the hall for a moment in the twilight for the sun at io of a hot day was hardly out of the sky mary jack in their dress clothes took me back some years more accurately they took me back to the new english art club she with her plastered hair he with his ruddy face black riband across his shirt front home in the carriage i saw jean thomas remained hidden behind an officer i dodged her successfully on getting out then hurrying up the main road distinctly heard myself called o theres virginia i hesitated but judging such rudeness impossible turned back saw jean was received with the utmost surprise for she had been talking about a cab though thinking so she said of me she introduced me to ann who used to figure so when i was in bed the lady with the romance in india which jean prayed she might have strength to overcome i could only see a featureless shape strode on again jean begging to come see us very cordially i admit it may be vanity but people do certainly show themselves very cordial anxious to come all the way out herei think we make a good mixtureat any rate here are the sangers kot gertler pippa all waiting to be fitted in while ottoline never ceases to gape wide for a week end and weve promised one to the waterlows monday june another gap of ten days takes me to the conclusion of our waterlow visit with the sort of clumsiness one might expect of them theyve pitched upon a house in the village of oare taken it for years in spite of the way it misses all the good qualities one might have had with such a range to choose from you have a view of a dull farmyard only a glimpse of down the house stands in the village street too much in a hollow to be capable ofa view sydney has mellowed grown less susceptible to the good bad opinions of his friends she is a gnome like figure but acute as the unattractive women tend to be depending upon hard work for their wages she produced excellent food manages the two unattractive children without a nurse all is black round me she said during a discussion on saturday night i get no acute sensations i wonder if its worth while s talks of taking to literature again the defect of the household lies in their relationship she has no admiration for him he no romance about her clear eyed people could scarcely feel otherwise but how i hate the average strictly speaking theyre both above the average the average is a very queer study though humble aspiring without illusions none of these qualities are common with the people we see for the most part i must run over the names of those weve seen in io days so far as i can remember them ray for the night molly for dinner also for the night the sangers murrythe others are now forgotten ray lectured the wcg how strange it is to see ones friends taking their fixed shape how one can foretell middle age for them almost see them with the eyes of the younger generation rather a terror i think theyll say of ray she has the look of conscious morality which is born of perpetual testifying to the right she has grown heavier more dogmatic her attitudes are those of the public speaker woman used to knocking about the country she speaks in all the counties of england she has lost such feminine charm as she had she seems mature but she is made of solid stuff this comes through pleases me l likes her better than the cropheads we discussed the moral eminence of moore comparable to that of christ or socrates so r l held they challenged me to match him in that respect by any of my friends i claimed for nessa duncan lytton desmond something different but of equal value r tends to think us a set of gifted but good for nothing wastrels her days work gives her some claim to look down upon us but it would be unfair to say that she condescends or judges she merely makes one aware of a different ideal what ideal does molly live for a very wandering will o the wispbut she chases it sticks in the bog poor woman hasnt the clearest of notions as to what shes after she has desmonds character on her mind she imagines that he is much talked about greatly derided its worth noting for my own benefit how very little talk goes on compared with the victims notion of what must go on she had ready an elaborate defence of d but finding it unneeded she confessed to the truththat she finds him a little spoilt terribly without a will much at the mercy of any fine lady or gentleman with good wine i couldnt deny all this i believe she worries herself acutely let alone the worry of money she has a sense of failure of decadence infulfilment she means to give up london live in the country as an attempt at cure but theres something sordid about it nowno longer pure fun she finds his mind vitiated his views no longer so interesting murry the sangers came here to supper last sunday dora becomes increasingly ungainly she has become so lame that in order to take off her boots she has to kick out one leg then hunch herself round into an attitude where she can crook hold of it again indeed i had to do it for her murry was pale as death with gleaming eyes a crouching way at table that seemed to proclaim extreme hunger or despair charlie has his wintry brightness still but weighed down by all this cadaverous company he scarcely chirped his best and after dinner such a duet of despair was croaked by murry dora as warmed the cockles of doras heart at christmas said murry i was near suicide but i worried out a formula which serves to keep me going its the conception of indifferentism i have hope no longer i live in layers of conscience but i forget what these were dora egged him on sounded his praises when we went through the struggle with the boots again but to us he seemed less nice perhaps more anxious for effect this time than before despairing young men who have worked out philosophies describe them remind me too much of henry lamb but theres more than that in murry i expect he is used to being an oracle in the underworld then leonard went to the annual dinner which was almost a dinner in honour of lytton but not very interesting to l at least i went to don giovanni to my infinite delight last friday june we went to the league of nations meeting the jingoes were defeated by the cranks it was a splendid sight to see the chief jingo was h g wells a slab of a man formidable for his mass but otherwise the pattern of a professional cricketer he has the cockney accent in words like day he was opposed by oliver strachey mrs swanwick adrian there were also present such gnomes as always creep out on such occasionsold women in coats skirts with voluminous red ties little buttons badges attached to themcrippled stammering men old patriarchs with beards labour men ourselves lord shaw presided sir w dickinson it was comical to see their polite horror at the sight of our party but hobson won by virtue i expect of his academic appearance wells when he found himself thwarted lost the sort of effervescent good temper he has struck out as wildly as he could spat sarcasms at williams hobson finally left the room but we found him caballing in the hall with mccurdie spender l is now in london hearing the result at a meeting of the executive monday june the league of nations intrigue hasnt stayed in our favour owing to various chicaneries practised by sir willoughby after the general meeting but im not competent to give a clear account of them the amusing thing to me is to see adrian transformed into an orator an agitator a man with convictions i cant take it quite seriously i mean i attribute it partly to his need of defending his own attitude as a co he is a little sheepish yet works out points circulates letters whips up converts k organises meetings of the godly at the club where they plan the most extreme measures its odd how people invariably fall into these separate groups cant be united each asserting a complete grasp of the right but all this week has been harassed beyond any enjoyment by the great servant question as i havent traced the stages i wont begin now the question was whether n l should go to nessa for months at first they agreed with gladness then they hesitated then they asked for assurance that we would have them back then they formally accepted then they violently refused then trissie arrived on a sudden as ambassador spent the night argued won her case lost it again finally she and i found a widow child in soho who take the place now all is as it was after more conversations emotions letters telegrams parleyings compromises k diplomacies than would have set europe in flame trissies character so far as i can make out is the one thing irretrievably damaged in our eyes the rest have slightly risen in value at one stage in this agony gertler kot dined with us gertler is a plump white young man got up for the occasion very sprucely in sponge bag trousers his face is a little tight k pinched but the word he would wish one to use of him is evidently powerful there is something condensed in all jews his mind certainly has a powerful spring to it he is also evidently an immense egoist he means by sheer will power to conquer art but bating this sort of aggressiveness he was well worth talking to l noticed his amazing quickness he would soon have told us the story of his life i felt about him as being formed in july or september but which was in october to merge with the league of nations society to form the league of nations union about some women that unnatural repressions have forced him into unnatural assertions he examined our furniture k pictures he likes shiny lodging house things best he said he has never felt akin to anyone he thinks himself very much cleverer than most painters kot sat indulgently silent professing scarcely to notice what was before his eyes they both described their jewish families on gertler as upon murry k katherine rests to my feeling the shadow of the underworld you could put no trust in him on principle i can imagine he is unscrupulous kot is differentrather in the style of the solid lodging house furniture but with an air of romance we had a visit from margaret which opened with a tremendous broadside of cooperative shop lamentations aspirations k too sanguine expectations all exaggerated so i felt in comparison with their real value the vote at congress against peace seems to her of unspeakable importance k horror she still talks of resigning next year but we were interrupted in this by a strange attack in one of ls eyes he dashed off to the chemist k left alone with margaret i became purely ribald l got fergusson to take out a small fly came back k went on again k m stayed till the last train she is a fine specimen of the public woman a type after all no less marked than the literary type though not yet so fully observed k recorded their eccentricities keep me amused when to tell the truth ive ceased to follow their plots k denunciations they have the habit of considering themselves driven to death overwhelmed with work without a possibility of rest k never once since ive known her has margaret owned to any state of health save that of being very tired but these peculiarities are not more than jokes to me k the directness k superb vigour of her character always overcome me with admiration given a keener mind or a subtler or some sort of discipline that shes never had she might have done marvels i sometimes guess that she thinks her work less good than it should have been or it may be only the terrific shadow of old age in to which no one not roger or goldie or any of them can enter without a shudder but these remarks on public servants might be written over again for ka too she dined with us last night k slept leaving punctually for her office this morning with an effort she will talk of other things but she seems bent k bowed under a load of responsibility which i believe to be timber at present in addition she broods over the war her own happiness i suppose went out very completely with ruperts death i fancy shes making up her mind to a life infinitely poorer j colder than she expected if this is so her illusion about the value of a j desk in the shipping office her hallucination about her own driven j exhausted harassed condition are merciful to us they seemed a little excessive its the atmosphere bred in an office as much as anything the common attitude shes been offered a hall at newnham so we all step into the ranks of the middle aged the responsible people the burden bearers it makes me a little melancholy failure would keep us young at any rate before tea this afternoon i finished setting up the last words of katherines stories pages thursday june the echoes of the great charleston affair may still be heard especially in the region of the kitchen but it will be needless i hope to take action on their account any more i wasted tuesday afternoon writing first a violent then a pacific letter to nessa with my version of our virtue trissies baseness l took proofs meanwhile the labour congress of course makes it impossible to bring that book to a close l was there all day yesterday had the sensation of kerenskys surprise visit i still find it difficult to make head or tail of labour party politics or indeed of any other but with practice i suppose it wouldnt be harder than reviewing mr merrick the interest in politics thrives among our friends just now adrian karin have become rebels extremists are seen in every gallery meeting place l had to repeat the whole story twice over after dinner first for margaret then for bella bella is antibolshevik but the significant thing is that everyone takes some side or other everyone makes the state of the country his private affair mrs woolf herbert dined with us on tuesday she has i think the qualities of a person who has never altogether grown up in spite of children all her cares she gossips enjoys herself bursts into tears because she feels she ought to burst into tears but she tells her memories with spirit somehow deals with life very freely easily with the liveliest childlike interest in it all mixed with the most absurd conventions she chattered away about her first marriage how theyd travelled in austria how shed had a set of sables bought her trousseau at swan edgars but rasselas says the trutha very fine truth she observed happiness is never perfective never found perfect happinessalways something missing virginia there she was taking back a bunch of cornflowers to bella because it was the anniversary of dicks death herbert cordial distant detached as usual at the club yesterday i picked up the times read of aunt minnas death days ago at lane end she is buried there today she was in her st year a more composed outwardly useless life one cant imagine she merely lived all that length of time without adventures sorrows difficulties doubts actions she was always unperturbed i think her great quality was her good sense she was never in any way absurd or tiresome if necessary she would have been a person to ask some sorts of advice from i saw her a few weeks ago apparently unaware of death taking her house for years further saying precisely what shed said any timeabout good bad novels about george margaret how dalingridge wasnt really good country but of course one mustnt say so an elderly toady was with her who had been a great beauty once was still fine looking a kind woman according to aunt minna i expect that the poor old lady was more stoical than she let on certainly she never seemed selfish or callous always had her own small affairs which gave her just as much interest as she wanted she was too level headed too clear sighted to pretend for a second to feel more than she did or to ask for expressions of feeling gerald i think she was fondest of his change of mood troubled her a good deal she was very proud of george margaret she thought it necessary to tell me that at her age she couldnt ride a bicycle i believe too much money had always kept her more at a distance from life than was good for her she was a great supporter of the duckworth family dies the last of them all monday july just back from tea at the club laden with cloths had on approval from souhamis l at the league of nations weve talked a great deal since i wrote last first there was the party at the club on friday i came late met lytton first then little sanger with his name written pinned to his buttonhole all sorts of people one half knew from the papersmen with shaggy hair great eyebrowswomen cadaverous or flamboyantmacdonald huysmans mrs despard thomas so on i was pitched strangely enough into the arms of widow creighton who remembered me she said age perhaps has toned her dogmatism i found her easy enough a sincere fine old thing her face emerging out ofa mist of flesh looking infinitely seamed worn like an immensely old sun shining through the mists she said middle age was happier than youth i was shot on again we dined with a k a good dinner downstairs then sat by their open window looking on to parliament hill at we went on to rays partya dull affair neither respectable nor bohemian inundated with belgians i talked to jack hills however very much like our version of himemphatic sententious k very trusty k kind i felt him pathetic too so much seems to have gone wrong for him on saturday i went to tea with janetbut my hand shakes so with carrying parcels that i cant write tuesday july my hand shakes no longer but my mind vibrates uncomfortably as it always does after an incursion of visitors unexpected k slightly unsympathetic ones talked nonsense ones ashamed theyve been uncomfortable the contact of one with the other was difficult i was reading macaulays life over my tea l seeing snowden in london when mrs woolf was announced edgar k sylvia called in on their way through richmond he is a good deal nicer than she is as i think ive recorded earlier in this book i take her to be as near the average of her sex class k age as may be given putney as birthplace k middle class origin k rather moderate means the great machine turns out millions like her every year however they are supplied with a number of ready made remarks into the bargain so we talked away our minutesk now they are gone but what led him to marry her my dear boy she calls him i started folding kms story this afternoon k went round to the printers who will only give half a promise to have his press free tomorrow every conceivable obstacle is flung across our road though we do our best to come out this next week influenza which rages all over the place has come next door thursday july we had a great bout of people yesterday as we tend to do nowadays mary hutch clive k borenius they had been seeing pictures at sir cooks house k came in later elegant frivolous all garrulous except mary who scarcely speaks wanting tea l was printing so i sat in the midst and we engaged in conversation borenius is i fancy a goodnatured bore of the foreigner type they tell long very explicit stories launching out on them on the least provocation but for one evening it did very well they dined here k again we assembled in the drawing room talked till we could scarcely see each other bs stories filled considerable space how hed been made a count other stories encroaching upon asquiths cunards clive jolly jovial cracking his whip kicking up his heels we discussed pictures jealousy derided a good many of our contemporaries but as usual i enjoyed it l not quite so much i took mary hutch over the house a very shy or somehow unforthcoming woman nice i expect beneath such a fuss exquisiteness of dress get up that one has doubts whether she can be nice she is going to write a story for us if she can ever leave off scratching it out today friday s july l printed off die last of prelude only the title page dedication still to do today the printers machine is running rather to our alarm as he seems ignorant of it we may have his press for very fine hot tuesday july i cant fill up the lost days though it is safe to attribute much space in them to printing the title page was finally done on sunday now im in the fury of folding k stapling so as to have all ready for glueing k sending out tomorrow k thursday by rights these processes should be dull but its always possible to devise some little skill or economy k the pleasure of profiting by them keeps one content yesterday we had a day off k went together for a wonder to souhamis k i hereby make a vow to buy all draperies covers cloths rugs from him in future and never again go near the omega or the burnets we have obliterated that painful staring check under a pale green k blue persian cloth infinitely preferable l up in london seeing bonwick about the dummy copy k at club meeting an indian is now established in that institution perpetually playing chess saxon by the way dined with us on saturday k supplemented this dinner by a long unnecessary intimate discussion of his feelings k health on the telephone he doesnt get on with nick he says though barbara manages all right i believe he takes natural pleasure in feeling himself preferred in spite ofthe awkwardnesses now to my stapling margot asquith wife of the exprime minister and maud emerald cunard american wife of the wealthy sir bache cunard were celebrated hostesses whose invitations constituted a recognition of social intellectual or artistic arrival wednesday io july we have sent off our first copies this evening after spending the afternoon in glueing k covering they surprised us when done by their professional lookthe stiff blue cover pleases us particularly i must read the book through after dinner partly to find possible faults but also to make up my mind how much i like it as literature adrian k karin dined here last night k he spoke to the guild on peacevery composed clear well spoken putting on his spectacles k reading in his pleasant intellectual voice from notes he has traces of the judicial mind k manner the women were more stirred than usual though their reasoning isnt very very strong k they are of course ignorant but they would all have peace tomorrow on any terms k abuse our government for leading us on after a plan of its own when asked to join a peace meeting in hyde park on sunday mrs langston as spokeswoman intimated that on no account could they violate the sabbath what a terrible grip xtianity still hasshe became rigid k bigoted at once as if god himself had her in his grasp that i believe is still the chief enemythe fear of god but i was tactful enough to keep this view dark karin very voluble with her advanced views though i never see how she comes by them one cant trace any passion rain for the first time for weeks today k a funeral next door dead of influenza friday july just back from the club k therefore in the restless state most safely to be appeased by writing reading though ive don juan the tragic comedians verrall upon meredith crees upon meredith the poems of heredia k the poems of laforgue to read to say nothing of the autobiography of tagore k the life of macaulay being out of the question before dinner mudies i confess sickens me of reading i feel disinclined even to write what may become one of these books so like bales of stuff upon a drapers shelvesonly with out the solid merit of good wool i stood there with the pallid respectable got my allowance great storms have been beating over england the last days the result of the bishops importunity god being as usual spiteful in his concessions now threatening to ruin the harvest owe god a grudge for his effect upon the guild at the club we met lytton by appointment had tea downstairs talking mainly of his book his success the violent attack upon him by mrs ward in the lit sup yesterday she sees german brutality in his picture of nightingale clough professing to let the coarse caricature of arnold pass how this lights up the stuffed world of the first class railway carriage that she lives in lytton is getting walter raleigh to answer though i think nothing short of a coronet will impress her imagination he stays this week end with the dutchess of marlborough whom he met in the cunards box at the opera was fresh from mrs asquith mrs a is of opinion that the autobiography of haydon is superior to the confessions of rousseau she pressed upon him a copy of hubert crackanthorpes works he is under no illusion so far about the brilliancy or desirability of this set as familiars though very happy comfortable mellow in his success country life begs him to continue the series in its pages lalla vandervelde is going to act a play of his his only anxiety is whether fame will continue maynard watches eager for him to be converted but i see no chance unless pleasure will be his doom no i think hes safe really improved as i suppose most people are by encouragement yesterday the day before we spent glueing the book have now paid all our debts so that i suppose a great many tongues are now busy with km i myself find a kind of beauty about the story a little vapourish i admit freely watered with some of her cheap realities but it has the living power the detached existence of a work of art i shall be curious to get other opinions l rather gloomy now about the prospects of his review thomas has taken his name off the board on the ground that the trade unions have the same end in view this is rather cool as l gave them the idea i have bet shilling that all will be settled by oct ist l editor the review in being tuesday july on saturday july we took it into our head to do a little marketing since the book is off our hands temporarily so went to kingston with a basket but found peas beans much the same price there as here l bought a vellum grotius at a bookshop which promised better than it produced on sunday a wettish cloudy day as all these days have been since the duke of rutland fell on his knees we went to staines to say goodbye to philip who has notice to go to the front on monday i cant help having a good deal of sympathy with my mother in law not only in this parting but in her general attitude to life it is so lacking in selfconsciousness has a natural kind of rightness wisdom though she never says a clever thing in fact says many foolish ones her conventions are so absurd that they scarcely count we walked up down a narrow lane between beds of herberts vegetables she cried laughed k then gave me large eggs k ran about among all her children very lively k haphazard k affectionate evidently liking this sort of miscellaneous company of sons k their wives better than anything on earth but to give this effect i should need a chapter k rather hope one of these days to take one monday was as usual a day for london k tea at the club i was so foolish as to fritter on the blue penholder with which i write when i dont write suck on paper at a grossly extravagant shop in pall mall i justified these extravagances by the fact that you can get into the national gallery for nothing i spent an hour wandering there k then came back k tried to describe my impressions to vanessa but i see why i like pictures its as things that stir me to describe them but then only certain pictures do this k i insist for the sake of my aesthetic soul that i dont want to read stories or emotions or anything of the kind into them only pictures that appeal to my plastic sense of words make me want to have them for still life in my novel but the atmosphere of picture galleries always gloomy is worse than ever now when the glory of war has to be taught by a life size portrait of lord kitchener k almost life size battle scenes though as the battles are th century battles one can only look upon them as scenes in a gymnasium on rather a large scalei forget now who was at the club for tea but one may still safely seat alix in one chair k dress her in green gray coat k skirt with a leather belt round her waist k a despatch box by her side as shes not doing work for alix one cant tell whats in the despatch box tuesday was a day when i stayed at home k folded k stapled paper a french secretary from mr david davies interrupted me l makes tuesday a kind of receptacle for shooting meetings into on wednesday th we glued copies of prelude so far our present supply is ample it seems doubtful whether we shall sell more than a hundred clive writes a tolerant but not enthusiastic letter about it doesnt set the thames on fire or turn his fastidious head so he says bob trevelyan dined with us k adrian came in late bob has been through the great crisis of his lifewhich will find him in talk for many a day he has escaped the army k may now go either to france or holland his literary work is interrupted very seriously he upset me so by his statement that in his absence bessy would live with crompton daviesi mean stay with him in fact shes there tonight to see how she likes it that i did nothing but laugh at discreet intervals leonard k adrian joined in he is a ridiculous figure precisely like the false mandrill especially now that hes bent with the rheumatic k can only creep k crawl he is one of our egoists whats more he manages to be more malevolent than anyone i know under a cover of extreme good nature he reminds me of the man with the pointed stick who picks up scraps of paper so bob collects every scrap of gossip within reachk even stretches after those that are still beyond his reach he told me that hed heard i was taking my book about to publishers who presumably refuse to take it then he lamented the failure of kms story accepting my corrections of both statements but so half heartedly that hell repeat them wherever he goes he insisted too that he had met me at the verralls when he was an undergraduate in the ties and he rambled over a long argument about great musicians k great writers k he praised our friends books with one breath k found rather more fault than he had given praise with the other but his relish of all this gossip k malevolence is such that you cant grudge it him he went off at this morning with l k talked all the way up in the train about his experiences before the tribunal thursday july l spent hours trying to make sense of sir willoughby dickinson k the rest k at met him in the reading room ofthe london library first however i met a milk white horse in st james square wearing an ancient spanish saddle mounted upon red embroidered velvet an old men led it no sign of advertisement was visible perhaps some great duke rides abroad like this we went on to tea at the club what a tea two dry biscuits so that we had to resort to cake on coming home all the copies that we glued yesterday have gone white in the back we dont know the cause richmond rang up to offer me ruperts life for next week i told him that i should like to explain rupert to the public he agreed that there was much misunderstanding he was a very jolly sort of fellow he said im trying to get letters out of james the germans are not succeeding this time the weather is windy hot violently wet sunny all in turn we are once more getting safe through the moon tuesday july i think it was on friday that i was given my green glass jar by the chemistfor nothing its a jar ive always coveted since glass is the best of all decorations holding the light changing it at lewes for round jars the chemist asks on friday anyhow jack hills pippa dined here all went very easily freely jack has weathered life with great credit upheld so pippa says by his human sympathies turned by them in the direction of womans suffrage reform education for the poor so on though remaining nominally a conservative im somehow reminded of an excellent highly polished well seasoned brown boot by the look of him he always seems fresh from the country he gave us a long very vivid account ofhis campaigning from which one could easily gather his immense virtues as leader of men to my surprise too he knows about georgian poetry has read lyttons book condemns the victorians perhaps one was inclined to be supercilious to confound him with george gerald pippa spent the night she appreciates waller immensely we talked about the future of women next morning she is head of a kind of exchange for finding places training women who want work sees the future in those terms of course on saturday july we went to tidmarsh from the point of view of country there is nothing that we at least can say for it though the house garden are nice enough the river brings such a flood of cheap humanity down to it red villas perched everywhere people spending the week end at pangbourne with leather cases fishing rods lytton carrington were alone no servant was visible most of the waiting seemed to be done by carrington she is silent a little subdued makes one conscious of her admiring solicitous youth if one were concerned for her one might be anxious about her positionso dependent on l having so openly burnt the conventional boats she is to run her risk take her chances evidently lytton was fresh from the dss of marlborough dabernon who is taking his play in hand whatever there is in the way of london society is i suppose now open to him he is making his investigations not with a view to a permanent settlement rather to round off his view of human nature he declares he knows more different sorts of people than any of us but we disputed this a great deal of talk about rupert the book is a disgraceful sloppy sentimental rhapsody leaving rupert rather tarnished lytton very amusing charming benignant like a father to c she kisses him waits on him gets good advice some sort of protection he came up with us on monday to lunch with dabernon margaret dined with us i lay on the sofa caught only a few unintelligible phrases tuesday l went as usual to his committees there are difficulties about the review macdonald wants to make it part of his socialist review then there are difficulties about the league of nations unwin is bringing out the cooperation book but all these movements are as difficult as much hindered by jealousies and spites as well can be with this entry vw finishes the book the next diary v is of similar format the titlepage inscribed saturday july th hogarth house richmond saturday july as usual this diary has skipped a day or two but first one must pause to say that here a new volume starts the third therefore there is every appearance of a long though intermittent life if it survives the summer when the evenings are unfavourable to writing it should flourish in the winter perhaps the lack of coal may kill it we may have to live entirely at the club but to look ahead is disastrous considering how much has still to be recorded of time past on wednesday july i had one of my field days to london first to meet james at the club he was to tell me about rupert for my article his first words however were have you heard of kas engagement to hilton i asked no to arnold forster this annoyed me considerably i am glad that she should marry though she bade fair to be a marked spinster but marriage with waf will be merely a decorous sympathetic alliance making her more of a servant of the state than ever then as james had a medical examination we couldnt say much about rupert save that he was jealous moody illbalanced all of which i knew but can hardly say in writing fredegond appeared next i took her half way to charing cross she had been having confidences from alix was in the flood of affection for her these emotions are too much in the fisher spirit for my comfort her poems are soon coming out then having spread my rumour about ka which only comes through bob through a letter from af thus may not be true i hope it isnt i went up to gordon sqre where the vans were taking the furniture nessa in out of the room all the time of course clive mary appeared then everything goes over the same little rapids we all dined at the mont blanc clive has never forgiven mefor what i see that he is carefully following a plan in his relations with me resents any attempt to distract him from it his personal remarks always seem to be founded on some reserve of grievance which he has decided not to state openly youve wrecked one of my best friendships he remarked by your habit of describing facts from your own standpoint what you call gods truth said nessa one couldnt have an intimacy with you anyone else at the same time you describe people as i paint pots you put things in curl k they come out afterwards mary murmured from the shadow of her sympathetic silence clive however had bitterness of some sort in what he said he meant me to see that somehow i had ended our old relations now all is second best it was clear also that he lives in dread of some alliance between mary me which shall threaten his position with her he protested that to show her letters of his would be unfair on my part or on nessas she is a blank book after our much written rewritten scratched out torn out pages the situation is complicated delicate enough he cant make up his mind to cut adrift from me altogether but he paid for my dinner we wound up good temperedly the rain pelted down i rushed for my train i wish i had had the patience to write down the more intelligent parts of our talk criticism of books life not of people feelings but i become too critical of badly written criticism write so hurriedly that it would certainly be bad on thursday we had a day off in which we glued some more copies of prelude i think only one more order has come in people complain that though clever all that the story isnt complete on friday th l went on his round of league of nations club i to omega for rogers new paper to gordon sqre for pictures then laden intolerably to the club for tea by rights of importance i should remark that today l was asked to stand for parliament havent yet turned my mind that way a natural disposition to think parliament ridiculous routs serious thought but perhaps it isnt so ridiculous as speeches make one suppose journalists were given tea at the club i went upstairs hid behind a door saw mrs hamilton for the first time or rather heard her holding forth like a jolly club man for i didnt dare look james to dinner he promises to send us ruperts letters to typewrite at asheham but some queer strachey intrigue is at work on the matter monday july im paralysed by the task of describing a week end at garsington i suppose we spoke some million words between us listened to a great many more chiefly from the mouth of mrs hamilton who strains at her collar like a spaniel dog has indeed the large hazel staring eyes of one of them there was gertler shearman dallas for tea brett ottoline children philip the string which united everything from first to last was philips attack upon murry in the nation for his review of sassoon he was half proud of himself half uncomfortable at any rate i was taxed with being on murrys side before io minutes was out then to prove his case philip read murrys article his letter his letter to murry three times over so i thought emphasising his points lifting his finger to make us attend and there was sassoons letter of gratitude too i think ott was a little bored happily the weather was fine the food good we flowed about happily enough without serious boredom which is more than one can ask of a weekend in fact for some reason i was rather well content my bed was like layer upon layer of the most springy turf k then the garden is almost melodramatically perfect with its grey oblong pool pink farm buildings its soft whitish grey stone enormous smooth dense green yew hedges down these paths we wandered once or twice with ott once with mrs hamilton she is a working brain worker hasnt a penny of her own has the anxious hard working brain of a professional earning her living all the time im not sure though that she didnt compare very well with ott some time after tea we three meandered off to the woods but we never got there of course ott sat upon a gate very soon discussed the character of ly margaret sackville as usual ott deplored marvelled at the very characteristics which one would have said she knew at first hand however her drift is always almost bewilderingly meandering i believe she often doesnt know her own motives for taking a special line the difficulty is that anyone listening perceives some motive unconfessed k this gives her talk rather a sir montague shearman a kc and a judge was a collector of pictures and a particular friend and patron to mark gertler patrick dallas was a friend of both and was at this time going to pieces see mark gertler selected letters edited by noel carrington p distracting wearying effect halfway up a hill in the sun she stopped leant on her parasol looked vaguely across the landscape began a discourse upon love some wind seems to blow half her words away another reason for finding her difficult to listen to isnt it sad that no one really falls in love nowadays its the rarest rarest thingi mean they dont see each other ideally they dont feei that every word is something too wonderful just because the other has spoken it bertie does of coursebut then his choice is so often unfortunate here chiefly in order to get us home i said that love meant a great j many different things that to confine it to romantic love was absurd i also maintained that one could love groups of people landscapes unluckily this remark led ott to lean on her parasol once more look longingly at a wheatfield i yes i love thatjust for itselfthe curve of that wheatfield seems to me as divine as any human being ive always been like that ever since i can remember i love literature too i love quite absurd thingsthe ilp for instance said mrs hamilton at last we got moving again we asked the poor old ninny why with this passion for literature she didnt write ah but ive no timenever any time besides i have such wretched health but the pleasure of creation virginia must transcend all others i said it certainly did though i think the remark ought to have been made to include mrs hamilton too we trailed back through the village where all the peasants were lounging in the road with their pipes their dogs k their babies the most affable ek im afraid obsequious greetings were exchanged the dazzling appearance of ott k her pearls seeming to strike the agricultural labourer neither as wrong nor ridiculous but as part of the aristocratic show that hed paid for no one laughed old ladies in black were eager to stop k talk about the hot weather they seemed all a little excited k very anxious to please very nice people arent they she said when we came in k i daresay nothing for the next years will make them otherwise i was taken to gertlers studio k shown his solid unrelenting teapot to use bretts word he is a resolute young man k if good pictures can be made by willing them to be good he may do wonders no base motive could have its way with him k for this reason i havent great faith in him its too moral k intellectual an affair or perhaps the natural gift is not abundant enough to cover his conscience k will power he says straight out what he thinks sits very upright everything tight curled tense muscular about him his art an agony often as he told me but at last he understands that he wishes to paint form in the brightest colours form obsesses him he sees a lamp as an imminent dominant overwhelming mass of matter ever since he was a child the solidity the shapes of objects have tortured him i advised him for arts sake to keep sane to grasp not exaggerate put sheets of glass between him his matter this so he said is now his private wish but he can think pianola music equal to hand made since it shows the form the touch the expression are nothing wednesday july arrived at asheham i sit as if in the open airthe drawing room providing only a shell of shade in the intense heat the air dances over the field the smoke of the farm on the meadows mixes with the haze the garden is overgrown the flowers crushed out however at this moment l is cutting our beans for dinner we spent yesterday doing jobs in london i saw a dead horse on the pavementa literal case of what politicians call dying in harness rather pathetic to meto die in oxford street one hot afternoon to have been only a van horse by the time i passed back again he was removed this shows what my business was mudies the club i loitered past jewellers windows looking for a stone to replace my sapphire lost in the train going to garsington pale cracked emeralds of doubtful value tempt me greatly lytton alix at the clubthe last scene of that familiar drama lytton was on his way to catch a train alix i suppose never catches them terrible though it is to think of she is sitting in the club at this momenta kind of fate surveying the passage of moral generations lytton had lunch with lord dabernon together with lord ribblesdale a vulgar appreciative litde manager who asked to read his chinese play gave hopes of producing it lytton affects to think poorly of it ive forgotten what i think i complimented him on the change in carringtonhe has improved her ah but the future is very darki must be free i shall want to go off i suggested that she might follow suit which did not perhaps quite please him in the street we passed oliver the flashing inez were then stopped by kot who wanted us to come meet d h lawrenceor perhaps to ask him here kots blood shot eyes general sordidity struck us in the middle of st james square he is a mysterious figure not only in his occupations but in his desire to be a friend of ours though he seems without many friends anyhow he was the last person we saw in london since mr cox ofthe london library doesnt count today the servants were off by a oclock train we came by clapham meant to go by east grinstead but found places in the lewes train after all got to glynde about not a bad journey everyone congratulated themselves on finding room at all after the rumours about crowds that have been put about in my carriage we were a family party according to the extremely capable friendly dogmatic jew business man who took us in charge these are queer meetings so impressed on one at the time then so rubbed out already ive half forgotten the soldier with the nickel knee plate the metal arch to his foot though he talked at the top of his voice boasted made me hate him i have forgotten the women with children who drank a few drops of whiskey how we were all offered drinks of tea bites of sandwiches were helpful kindly on our best manly womanly behaviour we ate our lunch under some trees coming from glynde saturday august theres nothing but rustic news to record since as we expected the murrys have put us off katherine writes that shes ill i cant help guessing that she may be rather hopelessly ill anyhow its out of the question that she should come here the weather hasnt held good yesterday was as wet a day as england often produces almost always the afternoon is dry in england so it was more or less we went mushrooming in the evening got a handkerchief full so one of our great excitements has begun again one ripe blackberry was found at the top as i lay in the grass a hare loped past me perhaps were rather pleased to be alone after all better weather today though a black sky is about the ugliest thing in nature l to lewes he went to fetch a parcel from the new statesman which wasnt there i round ms walk over the top my record must be solely of beetles butterflies a ray of sun brings out the brown heaths in any number over newhaven an airship floated the sky being blue for a space the sea was too it struck me as odd to think of all the blazing blue safely burning behind the clouds how a ray on the earth made a different place of it i must go and pick shrooms the sun being out monday august while waiting to buy a book in which to record my impressions first of christina rossetti then of byron i had better write them here for one thing i have hardly any money left having bought leconte de lisle in great quantities christina has the great distinction of being a born poet as she seems to have known very well herself but if i were bringing a case against god she is one of the first witnesses i should call it is melancholy reading first she starved herself of love which meant also life then of poetry in deference to what she thought her religion demanded there were two good suitors the first indeed had his peculiarities he had a conscience she could only marry a particular shade of christian he could only stay that shade for a few months at a time finally he developed roman catholicism was lost worse still was the case of mr collinsa really delightful scholaran unwordly reclusea single minded worshipper of christina who could never be brought into the fold at all on this account she could only visit him affectionately in his lodgings which she did to the end of her life poetry was castrated too she would set herself to do the psalms into verse to make all her poetry subservient to the christian doctrines consequently as i think she starved into austere emaciation a very fine original gift which only wanted licence to take to itself a far finer form than shall we say mrs brownings she wrote very easily in a spontaneous childlike kind of way one imagines as is the case generally with a true gift still undeveloped she has the natural singing power she thinks too she has fancy she could one is profane enough to guess have been ribald witty and as a reward for all her sacrifices she died in terror uncertain of salvation i confess though that i have only turned her poetry over making my way inevitably to the ones i knew already wednesday august asheham diary drains off my meticulous observations of flowers clouds beetles the price of eggs being alone there is no other event to record our tragedy has been the squashing of a caterpillar our excitement the return of the servants from lewes last night laden with all ls war books the english review for me with brailsford upon a league of nations katherine mansfield on bliss fl threw down bliss with the exclamation shes done for indeed i dont see how much faith in her as woman or writer can survive that sort of story i shall have to accept the fact im afraid that her mind is a very thin soil laid an inch or two deep upon very barren rock for bliss is long enough to give her a chance of going deeper instead she is content with superficial smartness k the whole conception is poor cheap not the j vision however imperfect of an interesting mind she writes badly too i and the effect was as i say to give me an impression of her callousness j hardness as a human being i shall read it again but i dont suppose i shall change shell go on doing this sort of thing perfectly to her murrys satisfaction im relieved now that they didnt come or is it absurd to read all this criticism of her personally into a story j anyhow i was very glad to go on with my byron he has at least the male virtues in fact im amused to find how easily i can imagine the effect he had upon womenespecially upon rather stupid or uneducated women unable to stand up to him so many too would wish to reclaim him ever since i was a child as gertler would say as if it proved him a particularly remarkable person ive had the habit of getting full of some biography wanting to build up my imaginary figure ofthe person with every scrap of news i could find about him during the passion the name of cowper or byron or whoever it might be seemed to start up in the most unlikely pages and then suddenly the figure becomes distant merely one of the usual dead im much impressed by the extreme badness of bs poetrysuch of it as moore quotes with almost speechless admiration why did they think this album stuff the finest fire of poetry it reads hardly better than lel or ella wheeler wilcox and they dissuaded him from doing what he knew he could do which was to write satire he came home from the east with satires parodies of horace in his bag childe harold he was persuaded that childe harold was the best poem ever written but he never as a young man believed in his poetry a proof in such a confident dogmatic person that he hadnt the gift the wordsworths keats believe in that as much as they believe in anything in his character im often reminded a little of rupert brooke though this is to ruperts disadvantage at any rate byron had superb force his letters prove it he had in many ways a very fine nature too though as no one laughed him out of his affectations he became more like horace cole than one could wish he could only be laughed at by a woman they worshipped instead i havent yet come to lady byron but i suppose instead of laughing she merely disapproved and so he became byronic friday august in the absence of human interest which makes us peaceful content one may as well go on with byron having indicated that i am ready after a century to fall in love with him i suppose my judgment of don juan may be partial it is the most readable poem of its length ever written i suppose a quality which it owes in part to the springy random haphazard galloping nature of its method this method is a discovery by itself its what one has looked for in vainan elastic shape which will hold whatever you choose to put into it thus he could write out his mood as it came to him he could say whatever came into his head he wasnt committed to be poetical thus escaped his evil genius of the false romantic imaginative when he is serious he is sincere he can impinge upon any subject he likes he writes cantos without once flogging his flanks he had evidently the able witty mind of what my father sir leslie would have called a thoroughly masculine nature i maintain that these illicit kind of books are far more interesting than the proper books which respect illusions devoutly all the time still it doesnt seem an easy example to follow indeed like all free easy things only the skilled mature really bring them off successfully but byron was full of ideasa quality that gives his verse a toughness drives me to little excursions over the surrounding landscape or room in the middle of my reading and tonight i shall have the pleasure of finishing himthough why considering that ive enjoyed almost every stanza this should be a pleasure i really dont know but so it always is whether the books a good book or a bad book maynard keynes admitted in the same way that he always cuts off the advertisements at the end with one hand while hes reading so as to know exactly how much he has to get through everyone so far has failed us katherine ill ka will af obliged to work next sunday so in a wild desire to couple bonwick with someone who will mitigate his tedium weve wired both to marjorie strachey mrs hamilton rather wickedly i dwelt to marjorie upon the fair hair of b but she has drawn it upon herself by her confession or rather statement that she intends to marry monday august i believe this is near about the anniversary of our wedding day years ago august bonwick came but marjorie mrs hamilton only sent telegrams being a man of business he made the most of his holiday came toiling up the hill to find us where we were picking blackberries a straight commonplace rigid kind of man impervious to anything at all different from the usual going down the hill he told us that he spent a fifth of his income on prisoners of war in order to justify his exemption as a co our talk was almost wholly about the nation it was his only topic the poor man has a strong cockney accent a perservering aspiring selfsatisfied mind making great play with his literary connections pretending to be the most important part of we when he speaks as he always does of the nation to tell the truth i got my first inkling of the lure of gold through hearing him talk he gave out that he deals in hundreds k thousands they are rowntrees hundreds thousands but mr b has the easy powerful air of one who deals in them rowntree asked me if the nation could afford it a year i said yes so he did it yes we pay our writers increased rates now hobson chanced to say that he had never made so little by the nation so i told rowntree the fees ought to be raised i imagine him sitting at a desk in an ante room opening the door for people who want to see massingham he told us that mrs phillimore has been offered for a book of her religious sketches he told us lots of gossip how edward garnett was turned out how they got scores of letters against rogers articles madmen write to them i am the son of god but i was more impressed by his commercial bearing than by his anecdotes he told them a little as if he were superior to all these literary peoplebut i confess that the mosquitoes are biting my toes a moth is dropping perpetually from the lamp so that i cant remember all the things i meant to say about mr bonwick leonard is staying with him at my place near croydon tonight goes tomorrow to york to see rowntree l declares that the profound psychologist would find b chiefly remarkable for a complete lack of humour friday august my visit to charleston ls to york are both partly responsible for this skip but ive skipped too much to give a very full account of one or of the other bonwicks villa precisely expresses bonwick a stuffy smell thrown in windows curtained in thick white pictures of niagara they spent hours in travelling to york back the result still to await another meeting of trustees though bonwick is sure they mean to agree the labour people are to be dropped my visit to charleston was spent mostly in sitting in the drawingfroom talking to n while she made herself a small brown coat duncan wandered in out sometimes digging a vegetable bed sometimes painting a watercolour of bedroom china pinned to a door in the evening there was the lumpish bunny inclined to be surly n inclined to take him up sharply what did we discuss there was kas engagement concerning which duncan had a good deal to say one ofhis statements being that af is always has been another is that he lent to certain affections practised them in an italian villa i made out a description of garsington the hunger of poor ottoline for some recognition in sussex is proved by her offering herself for any day in the summer after july th she was abruptly told that none suitedwhich explains her eagerness to insert her foot here then we discussed the adrian stephens he a dead weight she a live one according to n who warns me we shall repent of asking them herethis in front of duncan too who said nothing to contradict so our relationships change imperceptibly enough when n i were alone i supposed we discussed the two parrokeets money which is not any longer such a distant speculative sort of commodity as it used to beat least to her we discussed the children too the sort of talk that runs on when one knows all the facts but wishes to ascertain how theyve changed position what for instance is lyttons view of mrs asquith hers of him maynards of them both gertlers notions of painting his views oi their painting duncans fame bunnys socialism bunny thus defines his position all capitalists are wrong therefore for him to live upon vanessa is good inasmuch as she enjoys money that she has no right to could not possibly spend her interest better than by maintaining him this evolved from a sentimental declaration by him that he ought to spend his life in giving honey to his friends for nothing his brain must be a tangle of sentiments halfrealised socialism i bicycled back on wednesday found l we were very happy until it came to the fat baconwhen alas monday august its possible that we may have solved the problem of having visitors not to see them at this moment a k are in the house as an occasional sound from the drawing room proves but we only meet at meals so that it is possible to think of things to say in the intervalsfi find that deafness imposes itself upon the mind as well as the voice it frightens i away the quicker shyer deeper thoughts so that all the talk that reaches a deaf person must be of the same hearty plain matter of fact kind try as one will one cant do otherwise carrington came for the weekend she is the easiest of visitors as she never stops doing thingspumping scything or walking i suspect part of this is intentional activity lest she should bore but it has its advantages after trudging out here she trudged to charleston only came in at eleven last night just as we were shutting the windows poor lugubrious bunny escorted her protesting that a io mile walk was nothing compared to the joy of having some one to talk to she trudged off again this morning to pack lyttons box or buy him a hair brush in londona sturdy figure dressed in a print dress made after the pattern of one in a john picture a thick mop of golden red hair a fat decided clever face with staring bright blue eyes the whole just misses but decidedly misses what might be vulgarity she seems to be an artistseems i say for in our circle the current that way is enough to sweep people with no more art in them than barbara in that direction still i think carrington cares for it genuinely partly because of her way of looking at pictures i finished by the way the electra of sophocles which has been dragging on down here though its not so fearfully difficult after all the thing that always impresses me fresh is the superb nature of the story it seems hardly possible not to make a good play of it this perhaps is the result of having traditional plots which have been made improved k freed from superfluities by the polish of innumerable actors authors critics till it becomes like a lump of glass worn smooth in the sea also if everyone in the audience knows beforehand what is going to happen much finer subtler touches will tell words can be spared at anyrate my feeling always is that one cant read too carefully or attach enough weight to every line hint that the apparent bareness is only on the surface there does however remain the question of reading the wrong emotions into the text i am generally humiliated to find how much jebb is able to see my only doubt is whether he doesnt see too muchas i think one might do with a bad modern english play if one set to work finally the particular charm of greek remains as strong as difficult to account for as ever one feels the immeasurable difference between the text the translation with the first words the heroic woman is much the same in greece england she is of the type of emily bronte clytaemnestra electra are clearly mother daughter therefore should have some sympathy though perhaps sympathy gone wrong breeds the fiercest hate e is the type of woman who upholds the family above everything the father she has more veneration for tradition than the sons of the house feels herself born of the fathers side not of the mothers its strange to notice how although the conventions are perfectly false ridiculous they never appear petty or undignified as our english conventions are constantly made to do electra lived a far more hedged in life than the women of the mid victorian age but this has no effect upon her except in making her harsh splendid she could not go out for a walk alone with us it would be a case of a maid a hansom cab saturday august i had to look carefully before i wrote saturday stranger still one wont know that its sunday tomorrow i suppose if i werent too lazy i think i should try to describe the country but then i shouldnt get it right i shouldnt bring back to my own eyes the look of all those old beautiful very worn carpets which are spread over the lower slopes of the hills nor should i convey the look of clouded emerald which the downs wear the semitransparent look as the sun shadows change the green becomes now vivid now opaque however i confess that i shirk almost equally the task which has accumulated for days of describing our visitors they are with us for another week so i need not try to hit them this very moment bridge has broken down the partition between our sitting rooms l is playing at this moment binding himself to stop at but it is doubtful if he will i hesitate a little to write evil of my guests nor do i think evilexactly i refer in rather crablike fashion to something coarse material insensitive about karin one would never find much interest in her though nothing despicable or mean no but shes a capable american who will get all that can be had for the asking nothing that cant i have a theory that if one sense fails another does double work she eats enormously she has no concealed vices would she be more interesting if she had she is not stupid or dull or trivial on the contrary she is bright capable stirring stirring adrian to read books upon economics even stirring him to learn shorthand which according to her is useful in a literary career she intends him to have a career at any rate she is going to ask for that too for certainly adrian will never ask for anything for himself yet i confess it is yet to me he is happy gives one the sense of being well provided for as he provides her with good manners good looks good taste i feel myself frightfully superior so refined as to be almost apologetic to leonard so full of fine feelings subtle perceptions intellectual tastes the rest that i almost blush to sit here alone writing or reading milton she informs me that i with my tastes would have much in common with hope mirrlees with my tastes indeed this account emphasises our points of difference outwardly we are all good friends talkative in agreement not relying on gossip merely to despatch dinner with we talk about the labour party politics anarchy government she understands an argument deals with an article manfully and in her way shes a nice honest creature not so sure of herself when it comes to taste knowing it toothough taste has led her alas to embroider a pair of shoes which a obediently wears i must leave what i have to say about milton the german prisoners life other subjects for next time tuesday august now i confess that i have half forgotten what i meant to say about the german prisoners milton life i think it was that all i can remember now friday aug th is that the existence of life in another human being is as difficult to realise as a play of shakespeare when the book is shut this occurred to me when i saw adrian talking to the tall german prisoner by rights they should have been killing each other the reason why it is easy to kill another person must be that ones imagination is too sluggish to conceive what his life means to himthe infinite possibilities of a succession of days which are furled in him have already been spent however i forget how this was to go on the prisoner who looks very lean hopeless seemed to like talking i met him later we smiled but the sentry was not there here we are almost at the end of august finishing off a ks visit they go to charleston tomorrow its odd how in a visit of this kind one wears through different stages my stages are on the whole nearer to warmth liking than to irritation though there is an element of criticism in our relationship based partly on ks manners appetite appearance which last poor woman she cant altogether help still there seems no need to emphasise the natural process by an orange dressing gown held in by a broad band her appetite is frankly a schoolboys what beef she exclaimed today dont you feel elated at the sight of good meat meals add a sort of romance to her life such as i in my way get shall we say from the post or the newspapers i can imagine karin for instance thinking with a little thrill that next day is the day for salt beef as i think perhaps i shall get my book from the times or an interesting letter l on the other hand is irritated being irritated by superficial disagreeables finds deeper causes for them than i altogether agree with our usual method is to begin why did adrian marry her then i say i can quite understand itshe has energy so on then l says id a thousand times rather have married kain fact id rather have married any one in the whole world i couldnt sit in the same room with her still i do see why adrian married her first foremost she makes him like other people he has always i believe a kind of suspicion that whereas other people are professionals he remains an amateur she provides him with household children bills daily life so that to all appearances he is just like other people i believe he needs constant reassurance on this point takes constant delight in her substantiality yes one wants to be found doing the ordinary things when ones friends call i too have this feeling to some extent i suppose indeed that i share many of as feelings a feeling comes over me when i am with him that instead of being comfortably obtuse we are crepuscular to each other thus among other things fearfully shy when we are alone with other people in the room we get on much better we had a walk to the post marked by those cloggings of the wheels which are so discomfiting nothing seems possible then with an odious jerk one jars on again this was better managed than of old he lost his diffidence air of hearing himself talk when he told me about karin how deaf she is how depressed she gets how she thinks that people wont talk loud on purpose thus dislikes all stracheys others of the low voiced mumbling family he is very proud of her vitality i suppose it provides him with a good deal of the stuff of life which he does not provide for himself yesterday nd i bicycled to charleston lunched came home in the evening it was the first autumn day warm softly blue blurred with haze duncan spent the night before with us he stumbled along until by means which he only knows the secret of he had us all laughing until the tears came his chief effort was a description of lady strachey reading aloud laurence housmans the dying ploughboy speaks from the grave i hear the bells jingling i lie in my mothers bed the finest poem in the language too then we discussed the bursting of peoples bladders the national gallery incest perhaps other gossip all sitting in the drawing room until it grew too dark to see we have lamps almost at dinner but not quite i gossiped with nessa a new plan is on foot to supply her with liz for a cook trissie is goingbut never again into service she is one of the transition casesthe servant not yet turned lady but past servanthood karin a have gone into brighton to see a specialist about her ear tuesday september pernel came on saturday her coming was to have coincided precisely with the stephens going but there was a hitch here as the fly refused to take them thus we enjoyed another meal with karin i regret to say though that either natures protests or our mute ones have diminished her appetite so that she was no longer a show piece for a visitor she announced her intention of being wheeled to charleston on adrians bicycle which considering her shortness breadth great pillar like legs produced a comic picture so i think adrian judged it for he dissuaded her from mounting till they were at the bottom of the drive i think the best way to sum up the impression of pernel is to quote our simultaneous exclamation on going to bed on saturday night what a relief to talk to a human being part of the relief of course is the effect of her good ears but beyond this she is subtle finely graded with fine shades of understanding perception which are not after all entirely a matter of ears i suppose if karin were witness in her own behalf she might point to a certain faintness remoteness donnishness in pernel she does perhaps survey life through a tinted shade but her eyes are good ones she is too sensible humorous indolent to have taken the shape of a professor or indeed to believe very heartily in newnham or education or anything but books ideas poetry so on a more unambitious person does not live but she has not the dulness flatness which generally exist in these self effacing unselfish old maids i wonder what we talked about partly about hope mirrlees whom weve asked to write us a story jane lady strachey writing novels food last night l read hardys poems aloud the night before we discussed complexes then it turned out that she had been to a lecture upon potato blight i should never be surprised to find that she knows everything about turbines or bees everything that can be learnt from books that is she lacks the ambition perhaps the power to handle the things themselves here karin again has a plea to be considered i suppose she has done more things than pernel the weather was very windy but the mushrooms have come again she was rather unable to see them i suspect she mooned rather than looked about her she always arrives here provided with two shilling books with bright covers one to read coming the other going during the week end she always reads one classic one nonsense biography such as lady jeune i suppose however that she is in her quiet dreamy way obstinately conscientious something of a martinet towards herself nothing would ever induce me to marry she said with the utmost conviction indeed i should fancy that her bachelor life with many women friends a great many books lectures to prepare on french literature suit her perfectly this is written on the return from our great brighton treat everything succeeded l foretold a wet day by the light on our shutters but on opening them we found a perfect september morning the sun is thinner but very clear the air sparkling now that we are past august the colours are being burnished on the trees too the shadows seem lighter paler no one could confuse the rd of september with the st august a perfect treat must include a visit to the nd hand bookshops i bought the life of col hutchinson sweets we found chocolate unlimited lunch at muttons the band on the pier some human grotesques tea at booths buns at cowleys a trail past shops with many temptations to buy for the most part resisted a debauch at some stationer so home to find the downs this house lovelier than ever all these things we did we had too a feeling of lightness because of the villages won in france queant lens are taken as we learnt from a shop window cant one see the curtain lifting very slightly some promise of a world of food so on beyond i couldnt help thinking that the sight of an english gentleman walking the stubble after partridges with his sons his retriever was a foretaste of better days sunday september at anyrate today i am the wife of an editor leonard got a letter from bonwick to tell him that he is to get his first number out in january he wants to know what office accommodation l will require it is i think a great triumph to have steered through the shoals of macdonald trades unions rowntrees bonwicks all the rest the idea is very amusing stimulating too i like playing with imaginary offices sheets of notepaper little boys with buttons myself walking up the steps to take a cup of tea surveying the strand from the window perhaps therell be a shake down bed in the corner then miss matthaei in her little stall long galley proofs distinguished foreign visitors telegrams from distant capitals general importance glory everything a solid improving success yes a very nice prospect even on its picturesque side which i admit is the one most perceptible to me at the same time we had a letter from hoper offering to let us have asheham on a yearly tenancy in case he may ever want the housebut theres no present prospect of this we feel fairly safe again ka another letter says is to be married at tomorrow i cant help reading into her letter a sort of protest as to the merits of will her love for him yet even so i own that when i think of her i see her as a rounder warmer more complete person than she was single i suppose i had got into the habit of seeing her faithful solitary lonely till the end of time i like happiness too well to be very fastidious about the husband what has happened this last weekfollowing upon the superb success of brighton for one thing the weather has been so tremendously generous giving us after a veil of morning mist such an endowment of sun such clouds of alabaster firmly laid against the blue that even people likeshall i say melian stawellmust have felt jovial random unencumbered with high moralities or are they always bothering how to share the sunshine i remember lying on the side of a hollow waiting for l to come mushroom seeing a red hare loping up the side thinking suddenly this is earth life i seemed to see how earthy it all was i myself an evolved kind of hare as if a moonvisitor saw me a good life it is at such moments but i cant recapture the queer im n pression i had of its being earth life seen from the moon yesterday poor bunny came for the night bringing combs of honey for which he charges each how we were robbed at brighton for a mixture of milk saccarine poor old bunny he is as if caked with earth stiff as a clod you can almost see the docks nettles sprouting from his mind his sentences creak with rust he can only lay hands on the simplest words i suppose his vocabulary is now surpassed by mrs attfield equalled by fred however by dint of kindly treatment we softened him i must confess that for hours we did very well we wanted to know about mushrooms upon all funguses he is an authority indeed he discovered one of the smallest for the first time then he could tell us about the agricultural labourers union which is being half secretly organised even among our freds wills he has a humanity which is not all theoretical though he will insist upon breaking his brains over possible labour parties he talks to the german prisoners who are social democrats only fought because they would be shot for refusing consider the whole war a device of the artistocracy bunny looks forward to a democratic future i sacrificed half my morning sat with him hemming handkerchiefs as an example of his uncouth absurdity which one cant help liking he described to me a scene with hope mirrlees in paris he was furiousthe creature is a most enthusiastic friendbecause lawrences novel was reported burnt hope was staying in the same hotel he burst out to her upon the iniquity of burning books they had never met before she was so much ofhis way of thinking that he exclaimed you darling offended heralthough as he explained he was on the far side of the room used the word darling in its other sense i suppose he never had a rich vocabulary anyhow hope hinted that he ought to be in the army bunny could see nothing wrong or odd in calling a young woman you darling virginia he said intimately i want to ask you to give me a photograph ofalix he had one in mind which i was forced to give him to muse over as i can fancy by the hour in his half sentimental simplegood hearted way while he ploughs mr hexts fields with the motor plough but i was interested by his story of the attempted rescue of sovercar an indian bunny appeared like the manly serious romantic hero ofa meredith novel tuesday september i spend the first five minutes with this book before me trying to fish two drowned flies out of my ink pot on the tip of my pen but i begin to see that this is one of those undertakings which are quite impossible absolutely impossible not darwin or plato could do it with the tip of my pen and now the flies are increasing dissolving today there are three at asheham i naturally bethink me of darwin plato but in this i am not singular my intellectual snobbishness was chastened this morning by hearing from janet that she reads don quixote paradise lost her sister lucretius in the evenings i thought that no one in sussex was reading paradise lost at this moment janet holds the characteristic view that don quixote is more humorous than shakespeare the coarseness of shre i can see would distress her she would deal with it intellectually all her generation use their brains too scrupulously upon books seeking meaning rather than letting themselves run on for pleasure which is more or less my way thus naturally richest bestmargaret is said to be not so well im inclined to be hard hearted as i expect to learn to my cost one of these daysabout elderly ailments in general margarets in particular she seems to me to live in an atmosphere where cold feet are more important than bronchitis elsewherepart of the romance of life as food is to karin reviewing books is to me and then what an attentive solicitous echo is provided by lilian janet margaret dominates they taking pleasure in unselfishness lavish sympathy somehow make out a different scale of health for m than for the rest of the worldbut this is a little fantastic rises partly from the thought that i would if i were kind write a long affectionate amusing letter to m i am deterred from doing this by my prejudice against the patronage of the elderly i want neither to be patronised nor to patronise i feel that the sort of letter one writes on these occasions is an act of kindness so neither to be offered nor received inevitably the social worker approaches the nonsocial worker with a view to getting what they can give very slightly disparaging the giver who can be nothing better than a giver of amusement boredom is the legitimate kingdom of the philanthropic they rule in the metropolis though i am not the only person in sussex who reads milton i mean to write down my impressions of paradise lost while i am about it impressions fairly well describes the sort of thing left in my mind i have left many riddles unread i have slipped on too easily to taste the full flavour however i see agree to some extent in believing that this full flavour is the reward of highest scholarship i am struck by the extreme difference between this poem any other it lies i think in the sublime aloofness impersonality of the emotions i have never read cowper on the sofa but i can imagine that the sofa is a degraded substitute for paradise lost the substance of milton is all made of wonderful beautiful masterly descriptions of angels bodies battles flights dwelling places he deals in horror immensity squalor sublimity but never in the passions of the human heart has any great poem ever let in so little light upon ones own joys sorrows i get no help in judging life i scarcely feel that milton lived or knew men women except for the peevish personalities about marriage the womans duties he was the first of the masculinists but his disparagement rises from his own ill luck seems even a spiteful last word in his domestic quarrels but how smooth strong elaborate it all is what poetry i can conceive that even shakespeare after this would seem a little troubled personal hot imperfect i can conceive that this is the essence of which almost all other poetry is the dilution the inexpressible fineness of the style in which shade after shade is perceptible would alone keep one gazing in to long after the surface business in progress has been despatched deep down one catches still further combinations rejections felicities masteries moreover though there is nothing like lady macbeths terror or hamlets cry no pity or sympathy or intuition the figures are majestic in them is summed up much of what men thought of our place in the universe of our duty to god our religion wednesday september i have let the first freshness of the webbs fade from my mirror but let me bethink me of another metaphor which they imposed upon me towards the end of sunday i was exalted above a waste of almost waveless sea palish grey dented with darker shadows for the small irregularities the little ripples which represented character life love genius happiness but i was not exalted i was practically nonexistent this was the result of a talk with mrs webb in truth though they deserve more careful handling i wonder how i can recapture the curious discomfort of soul which mrs webb produces each time i see her again in the intervals one forgets in a second it comes over one again theres something absolutely unadorned impersonal about her she makes one feel insignificant a little out of key she represses warmth or personality she has no welcome for ones individuality she divines a little what ones natural proclivities are she irradiates them with her bright electric torch it was a pouring wet day on saturday not a day for geniality webb however has some coat to shake she is as bare as a bone we sat down to tea without george young they eat quickly efficiently leave me with hunks of cake on my hands after tea we were soon disposing of our topics c i began to feel nervous lest our cupboards should be bare then g young appeared having like all youngs rejoiced in his battle with distance wet liked the walk he said while he changed mrs webb rapidly gave me her reasons for saying that she had never met a great man or woman either at most she said they possessed remarkable single qualities but looked at as a whole there was no greatness in them shakespeare she did not appreciate because a sister who was a foolish woman always quoted him wrong to her as a child goethe might conceivably have been a great man then this having been dealt with down came l g young they all pounced together upon some spot of interest floating far out beyond my ken i think it was to do with the general election the views of the private soldiers young came provided with facts but i rather think these did not stand much investigation he is a slow stiff kindly man with all hiltons romance but less than hiltons brain through following his ideals he has left the diplomatic service is now a marine officer at portsmouth after dinner mrs webb plunged from brisk argument to unconcealed snoring then sidney had his turn i thought he spoke a little quick to conceal the snores but you have only to ask him a question he can go on informing you till you can hold no more he sketched his idea of a supernational authority the future of bills of exchange the work of government will be enormously increased in the future i asked whether i should ever have a finger in the pie o yes you will have some small office no doubt my wife i always say that a railway guard is the most enviable of men he has authority he is responsible to a government that should be the state of each one of us and then we discussed ls plan of a state so contrived that each person has to do some work here there was a long argument upon the growing distance between men of different social grades k professions young affirming it the webbs denying it i asked in reporting conversations ones own sayings stand out like lighthouses one of my most fruitful questions viz how easy is it for a man to change his social grade this brought down a whole shower bath of information but let us say that the webbs shower baths are made of soda water they never sink one or satiate webb told us how many scholarships were won in london in a given year also reported upon the educational system of e sussex which bad though it is is slightly better than that of w sussex i myself he said came too early to profit by secondary education my parents were lower middle class shopkeepers possessed like so many of their kind with a blind determination to educate their sons somehow but without a ghost of a notion how to set about it they hit on the plan of sending me my brother abroad to france germany so we learnt french german at least i can still read them though i seldom do our talk must have dealt fully with education for i remember that mrs webb woke with a start delivered herself of a statement upon the german wrong turning put young right on some point about the division of character intellect he was simple enough to separate them to prefer what he was quite unable to define she thrust him through through with her rapier but he persisted next day which was said to begin for the ws at when they begin teadrinking in their bedrooms i had to withdraw in order to do battle with a very obstinate review of wells joan peter my ideas were struck stiff by the tap of mrs ws foot up c down the terrace the sound of her rather high a rather mocking voice discoursing to l while she waited either for w to come or the rain to stop they walked on the downs till lunch i must now skip a great deal of conversation let us suppose that sidney beatrice i are sitting on the road side overlooking telscombe smoking cigarettes in bright sunshine while the silver queen slowly patrols above newhaven the downs were at their best set mrs w off upon landscape beauty recollections of india which she turns to when lying awake at night relishing the recollection more than the reality sidney one perceives has no organ of sight whatever pretends to none mrs w has a compartment devoted to nature so briskly narrating their travels impressions which were without respect for british rule we set off home i saw them from behind a shabby homely dowdy couple marching with the uncertain step of strength just beginning to fail she clutching his arm looking much older than he in her angularity they were like pictures in french papers of english tourists only wanting spectacles baedekers to finish them their clothes looked ill dusted their eyes peering in front of them my few private words came as i knew they would come when mrs w detached us two together passing southease church she asked me about my novel i supplied her with a carefully arranged plot i wished so at least i said to discover what aims drive people on whether these are illusory or not she promptly shot forth two aims have governed my life one is the passion for investigation by scientific means the other the passion for producing a certain good state of society by those investigations somehow she proceeded to warn me against the dissipation of energy in emotional friendship one should have only one great personal relationship in ones life she said or at most twomarriage parenthood marriage was necessary as a waste pipe for emotion as security in old age when personal attractiveness fails as a help to work we were entangled at the gates of the level crossing when she remarked yes i daresay an old family servant would do as well on the way up the hill she stated her position that one should wish well to all the world but discriminate no one according to her the differences are not great the defects invariable one must cultivate impersonality above all things in old age people become of little account she said one speculates chiefly upon the possibility or the impossibility of a future life this grey view depressed me more more partly i suppose from the egotistical sense of my own nothingness in her field of vision and then we wound up with a light political gossip chapter of reminiscences in which mr mrs webb did their parts equally so to bed to my horror in came mrs w early next morning to say goodbye perched in all her long impersonality on the edge of my bed looking past my stockings drawers po this has taken so long to write that we are now arrived at monday september so many things have accumulated that i can hardly proceed to that masterly summing up of the webbs which i intended i intended in particular to dwell upon the half carping half humorously cynical view which steals into ones description of the webbs i had meant to point out the good qualities which come from such well kept brisk intellectual habits how open minded they showed themselves how completely consistently sensible that i think deserves a line under it good sense seems to me their invariable characteristic how sensible it was not to fuss about goodbye or a collins how sensibly they approach every question whether of servants or politics putting their minds at your service without the least ostentation or flummery their horizon is entirely clear unless in the case of mrs webb as the medium said a cloud of dust surrounds them they have no illusions they survey the whole panorama which is amazingly clear to them stoically both for the race for themselves as individuals sidney is the warmer more human of the two one could even commit the impropriety of liking him personally which one can hardly do in the case of mrs webb how stoically with his perpetual little smile he remarked that they are now therefore may expect a stroke within the next years but if he could arrange things with the divine messenger he would compound somehow to die precisely at the same moment with my wife by rights lottie should have a whole chapter to herself at this point but to live through those things is unpleasant enough without reviving them here at this moment owing to what she overheard l say to me before breakfast i am uncertain whether we have servants or not to tell the truth completely indifferent such is the relief of being without them for a fortnight considering their unimportance they must be compared to flies in the eye for the discomfort they can produce ln spite of being so small but let us change the subject i went over to charleston last tuesday was shown his shells by quentin sat with nessa laid bare my sorrows which she can more than match then clive mary arrived in a motor car for teaso many were their parcels bags indeed mary produced chocolates cakes sweets in abundance im ashamed to say that that is my chief impression but i left soon after they promised to spend a night here so that i left unsaid unasked all my ideas questions she was as usual mute as a trouti say trout because of her spotted dress also because though silent she has the swift composure of a fish i walked home shoving my bicycle too badly punctured to ride well then the times began to shower books upon me i was reduced at one point to writing my review in the afternoon nor can i discover any reason why ones brains should be unavailable between when the telegraph girl rode up with a telegram from clive to put us off owing to some disease of marys we were both immensely relieved i threw down my pen as they say ate a large tea found my load of writing much lessened when i have to review at command ofa telegram mr geal has to ride off in a shower to fetch the book at glynde comes taps at the window about io at night to receive his shilling hand in the parcel i feel pressed important even excited a little for a wonder the book hudson was worth reading then on saturday we went to lewes by train bought a two handled saw fish envelopes then met gertler at the station came out here whether our exclamations on parting from our guests are good evidence i dont know but on this occasion we both cried good god what an egoist we have been talking about gertler to gertler for some hours it is like putting a microscope to your eye one molehill is wonderfully clear the surrounding world ceases to exist but he is a forcible young man if limited able respectable within those limits as hard as a cricket ball as tightly rounded stuffed in at the edges we discussedwell it always came back to be gertler i have a very peculiar character i am not like any other artist my picture would not have those blank spaces i dont see that because in my case i have a sense which other people dont have i saw in a moment what she had never dreamt of seeing so on and if you do slip a little away he watches very jealously from his own point of view somehow tricks you back again he hoards an insatiable vanity i suspect the truth to be that he is very anxious for the good opinion of people like ourselves would immensely like to be thought well of by duncan vanessa roger his triumphs have been too cheap so far however this is honestly outspoken as i say he has power intelligence will one sees paint good interesting pictures though some rupture of the brain would have to take place before he could be a painter vws asheham diary records that gertler departed on the afternoon of september there were no further visitors to stay and lw went twice to london for the day domestic and daily life in the absence ofthe servants occupied vws attention and no doubt left little time for writing in her main diary the coal almost ran out there was no more to be had it turned cold and they had to cut up wood each day for burning on zj september vw records news that bulgaria makes peace the next day they were both ill which vw attributed to poisoning by bad meat or flies she stayed in bed most of the following day with a headache on tuesday october the sturgeonsl ws sister flora and her parentsinlaw who lived at ashcombe house near leweswalked over and were given tea wednesday z october no i cant write to margaret davies i spent on her the first flush of ideas after tea it is fatal not to write the thing one wants to write at the moment of wanting to write it never thwart a natural process i had so much to say here too first how the weather has changed we are on the verge of winter our clocks were put back on sunday night simultaneously i went into thick clothes the sun lost half its heat the nights became bitterly cold we began to burn wood before tea to dine by lamplight to shiver without fur coats on our beds but the impulse that was to unite k fashion give sequence to my head full of ideas perished on the ill suited page to margaret davies monday october i infinitely regret my generous impulse to write a letter describing the webbs to margaret that evening my mind was full of ideas asheham deserved some richer farewell than i am able to give it disturbed as i am by the briskness of homecoming a little agitated by the servant problem that i have to face tomorrow i am inclined to dwell upon the warmth beauty of this room i have bought another glass jar for these things are in the foreground it is partly due to them partly to the dampness of the harmsworth press that i dont write first foremost of the german offer of peace certainly it made our hearts jump at asheham this morning but as the times insists upon minimising it not much exhilaration remains we came up by east grinstead to avoid the crowd a long journey therefore stopping at all the dullest places in sussexwest hoathly among others we lunched at valcheras k there looked into the lowest pit of human nature saw flesh still unmoulded to the shape of humanity whether it is the act of eating k drinking that degrades or whether people who lunch at restaurants are naturally degraded certainly one can hardly face ones own humanity afterwards saturday october the first week in london is always one of the richest k the rich weeks always tend to pass unrecorded i have my anniversary to celebrate also this diary is one year old k looking back i see how exactly one repeats ones doings for example this week we went to buy an overcoat for l last year we bought boots again there was the question of a party again what i may euphemistically call an argument nessa was in london too k i dined with her k clive only there was duncan too ek we dined at gordon square but lord greys meeting has no counterpart last year nor could i possibly have written then as i can now write that tomorrow mornings paper may bring news of an armistice possibly the fighting will be over this time next week whatever we have done this week has had this extraordinary back ground of hope a tremendously enlarged version of the feeling i can remember as a child as christmas approached the northcliffe papers do all they can to insist upon the indispensability delight of war they magnify our victories to make our mouths water for more they shout with joy when the germans sink the irish mail but they do also show some signs of apprehension that wilsons terms may be accepted l has just come in from staines with a paper which says with obvious gloom that the rumour is that germany agrees to evacuation she is not of course they add to be allowed to make any sort of terms meanwhile philip is in the thick of it maurice davies son has been killed greys meeting was impressive as meetings go which is not saying very much of course but it does amount to saying that grey himself struck me as a solid straightforward english squire curiously like uncle herbert magnified in appearance with the kind of open air honour sagacity which one feels to some extent in a man like wallerjack hills he said nothing but what one has read agreed with about a league of nations but he said it simply for a great statesman to have sense human feeling no bombast does produce an odd sense of wonder humility in me as if human nature were worth something after all i dont extend my charity to lord harcourt however who sat in front of us or to mrs asquith elizabeth they were in no way venerable or even striking but one sees that mrs a has triumphed by virtue of a whipcord vitality she is as tense as a stretched bow as lean wiry as a whippet vibrating like a fiddle but not a trace im judging by my view of her profile of any thing more profound or interesting as for poor pasty elizabeth she seemed to have come straight from behind marshall snelgroves millinery counter there was an enormous audience as we left people were passing about the rumour that the kaiser had abdicated i went on to my dinner at gordon square thence to the coliseum with nessa where we had to sit out an infinite length of miss clarice mayne after which we saw our balletschei cant achieve either the spelling or the speaking of it which isnt one of the best when i saw it i remembered it better done at covent garden maynard who has the generosity something of the manner now of an oriental prince had hired a brougham for nessaan infinitely small slow antiquated carriage drawn by a very liverystables looking quadruped roger duncan maynard nessa i all crammed in padded along slowly across london to chelsea somehow we passed ottoline brilliantly painted as garish as a strumpet displayed in the midst of omnibuses under an arc lamp she reappeared in the sitwells drawing room i had made acquaintance with the two sitwell brothers the day before at gordon square been invited to the party that very morning a review by me of edith sitwells poems had appeared in the times its strange how whole groups of people suddenly swim complete into ones life this group to which gertler mary h are attached was unknown to me a year ago i surveyed them with considerable almost disquieting calm what is there to be excited about or to quarrel over in a party like this i asked myself found myself saying the most maternal things to gertler who was wearing evening dress bought from the tipsy mr dallas for the first time we stood compared our sensations edith sitwell is a very tall young woman wearing a permanently startled expression curiously finished off with a high green silk headdress concealing her hair so that it is not known whether she has any otherwise i was familiar with everyone i think nina hamnet mary h jack h ottoline sheppard norton so forth i found myself discoursing to sheppard about sophocles never before have i seen him even momentarily serious i think of nothing but greek plays he said people and im not sure that i dont always see people as if they were in greek plays i liked him better than before still i think he found it awkward to stand discussing sophocles seriously so we parted my complete mastery of evening parties is shown by the indifference with which i am deserted the composure with which i decide upon my next choice i was a good deal impressed by this how calmly too i looked at my watch saw it was time to leave went out alone drove to sloane square not excited not depressed but contemplative introspective tuesday october i did not think i should so soon have to describe a meeting with a cabinet ministerthough i admit that we seem to be drifting without much desire on our part into a circle where the great officials are sometime to be found this is the doing of the international review mainly but herbert fishers visit wasnt due to the review it was very obviously due to old family affection i was sitting down alone to tea on sunday with my odious penny paper to read the germans having agreed to evacuate late on saturday night l being gone to sutton to speak about our colonies the servants out when the bell rang i saw several figures against the glass on opening the door i really couldnt at first collect my wits there were olive m heseltine herbert fisher the hs went off herbert came in as they had arranged beforehand was i nervous or proud or anything but interested anxious to pick his brains for news i dont think i felt a moments agitation for one thing he has lost his lean intellectual look his hollow cheeks are filled his eyes with that pale frosty look which blue eyes get in age his whole bearing very quiet simple when not speaking rather saddened subdued the number of deaths in his house caused this perhaps but i cant help thinking that london life has rid him of his desire to say clever things to undergraduates all the time anyhow we talked without stopping without difficulty wevewon the war todayhe said at once i saw milner this morning he says we shall have peace by christmas the germans have made up their minds they cant fight a retreat the general staff has faced the fact theyve had what i think the considerable courage to admit it of course we cant accept their present terms why that would leave them still the greatest military power in europe they could begin again in ten years time but it rests with the french lloyd george is going to paris on monday but they are holding out for the evacuation of alsace lorraine as a guarantee we shall probably demand the disarmament of certain regiments too but weve won the war he then told me how wed won the war which was according to him by taking a tremendous risk some time in july k leaving the english line held without reserves withdrawing the army to reinforce foch in his blow which was timed with french precision minutes before the german attack if it had failed there was nothing between the germans the channel ports there is now a good prospect of a complete defeat of the german army foch says i have not yet had my battle despite the extreme vindictiveness of our press the french press herbert believed that we are going to baulk foch of his battle partly because the germans will accept any terms to avoid it lloyd george has told me again again that he means to be generous to the germans we want a strong germany he says the kaiser will probably go i was a great admirer of the germans in the beginning i was educated there ive many friends there but ive lost my belief in them the proportion of brutes is greater with them than with us theyve been taught to be brutal but it hasnt paid each one of their crimes has turned out badly no one can face another war why in io years they could blot out london by their aeroplanes it cost us to kill a german at the battle of the somme now it costs us but the proportion of men who have never been hurt or even seen anything horrible is very large seeley told me the other day that hed spoken to thousands thousands of soldiers they all wanted the war conditions of life to go on without these bloody shells therell be trouble when they come back theyll find their old lives too dull im going to educate them its true but that wont begin yetnot in my time i want to reform the universities next then i shall have done i cant stay in parliament without office very likely i shall go back to oxford to teach so we talked on not altogether like a mrs humphry ward novel i tried to think it extraordinary but i found it difficultextraordinary i mean to be in touch with one who was in the very centre of the very centre sitting in a little room at downing st where as he said the wireless messages are racing through from all over the world a million miles a minute where you have constantly to settle off hand questions of enormous difficulty importancewhere the fate of armies does more or less hang upon what two or three elderly gentlemen decide herbert thinks there are or geniuses in the cabinet l george balfour possibly winston churchillhis definition being that they make everything appear different a number of mediocrities his qualities suppose are balance foresight culture importance seems to smooth away surface eccentricities to give people an appearance of simplicity they are very courteous but somehow no longer spontaneous people the taint of the family butler is on them but this was more visible when l came in alone with me h was very friendly quiet gave himself no airs of dignity friday october its quite obvious of course that for some reason perhaps not creditable to me i think hf worth many more words than ka say or saxon both of whom have dined here since my theory is that for some reason the human mind is always seeking what it conceives to be the centre of things sometimes one may call it reality again truth again lifei dont know what i call it but i distinctly visualise it as a possession rather more in hfs hands than in other peoples for the moment he makes all the rest ofthe worlds activities appear as ramifications radiating from him but this is roughly stated old ka anyhow is not in the knot in the middle of the web she came alone will having hurt his knee not being there in the flesh one didnt trace him in the spirit she seemed unchanged but i think decidedly happier a little defiant on wills behalf the poor little gentle weakly creature is stated to be wild queer his action in giving up his patrimony refusing to go to balliol is brought forward as proof for myself i distrust young men who return to nature on the wiltshire downs paint pictures of the sky only want more than anything to fly i own though that im judging from my ancient view of him at fitzroy sqre saxon we assume has found complete consolation in mrs stagg a new set of gold teeth we have never seen him so sprightly bold communicative he is already talking of his next visit to bayreuth he did not knit barbaras childs drawers only showed a slight asperity when nick was mentioned but i write hurriedly giving no account of the albert museum nor of our suspension over what one of the papers calls the precipice of peace since i must read a little about voltaire before going up to hear a promenade concert at the queens hall the truth is that nothing much more definite is yet known about peace wilsons second note came out on tuesday in which he used the word peradventure so far the germans have not answered but their retreat goes on last night beautiful cloudless still moonlit was to my thinking the first of peace since one went to bed fairly positive that never again in all our lives need we dread the moonlight wednesday october i went up to the concert heard the ghosts of lovely things since the substance somehow escaped me partly owing to my mood partly to the usual vulgarity of wood even so the ghosts of two bach pieces one for a duet of violins were exquisitely lovely edith sichel whose entire soul is now open to me through her letters makes me determine to write descriptions neither of pictures nor of music she makes me consider that the gulf which we crossed between kensington bloomsbury was the gulf between respectable mummified humbug life crude impertinent perhaps but living the breath of south kensington lives in her pagesalmost entirely i believe because they would not mention either copulation or wcs however this brings me to our dinner with the maccarthys when i borrowed this book the book has a sort of fascination for me i see the outside of that world so clearly take a kind of ribald pleasure in putting those figures into actionsending them slumming to pops concerts to the national gallery always full of high thoughts morality kindliness never seeing beyond high st kensington molly thanks to bloomsbury has escaped the ritchie touch her book is anyhow giving her some exquisite pleasure pain too her head so desmond said shrank to the size of an apple it is now swelling to normal again they were both in the best spirits extraordinary if you consider that they were in their own house no wine allowed they gave us an excellent meat dinner d has some hopes that if turkey makes peace he will be discharged will then take to wandering writing more articles thursday october the degradation of steel pens is such that after doing my best to clip file one into shape i have to take to a waterman fountain pen profoundly though i distrust them disbelieve in their capacity to convey the nobler profounder thoughts yes i can speak of myself with more confidence today as noble profound i am capable of standing for parliament holding office becoming just like herbert fisher perhaps to me the vote was as surprising as to some retired cleric in the vales of westmorland who will see in it the death knell of liberty i daresay preach a sermon to that effect next sunday then the great lady at stocks must be feeling uncomfortable though i am malicious enough to suppose that if by some process of selection she alone could represent belgravia in the house of lords the change would not seem so devastating imagine her neatly accoutred in black trousers so my imagination sees her upon the bench at the hague conference her book the reviews say lays emphasis upon the fact that her novels were once thought beauties we are just in from kingstontoday being a holiday l not going up to london printing not started mcdermott is generally invisible when we caught him was just going out partly in your interests i may say threw out ominous hints as to the decline of his business which threatens our seven pounds so we imagine back again to the superior fluency cogency of steel however having walked across bushy park heard a stag grating his throat in a very surly manner his doe being couchant by his side we took tram to kingston there heard the paper boys shouting out about the presidents message which we bought devoured in the train the main points are that he is keeping negotiations going though the times came out with a great headline no parley this morning he discriminates too between the german people the kaiser he will consider an armistice with the one but only complete surrender with the other anyhow the question is now laid before england france so another step in the tedious business is begun privately our minds are exercised about the question of going to tidmarsh on sunday lytton wired to beg us to yesterday saying desolation extreme the difficulties are the nuisance of moving work to be done herbert woolf his freda dining here on sunday yes herbert has been accepted by a certain miss freda majorwho she is or what she is except that she is reported very active i do not know saturday october here i am experimenting with the parent of all pensthe black j the pen as i used to think it along with other objects as a child because mother used it therefore all other pens were varieties eccentricities what i have to record with it is the cheerful news that i am once more seep for the last occasion in hot waterthis time owing to gertler monty shearmanmaryclivevanessawho exploded upon my head with reproaches for having almost brought her to disaster my conscience is clear but im coming to think that friendships maintained in this atmosphere are altogether too sharp brittle painful i have written to charleston to this effect if i could have letters from mary clive i should feel myself rewarded l is down at tidmarsh i write to relieve myself of the feeling which comes over me in his absence of being a besieged city we had a day in london yesterdaysomehow the charm of those days is not quite what it was am i getting blaseis the club less enthralling we went to the omega show met roger were invited to tea at his studio discussed the change in duncans style his fathers burial half church of england half quaker representation reality so on again waley coming in as we left we dined at a very hot place in soho where you have perhaps a stones weight of food given you for on again to the club where leonard made his speech about austria hungary as usual i find him not only very clear but with the right degree of passion to be interesting the audience as usual at the club seemed made of curiosities whose aberrations of feature had driven them up up the backwaters of life where they dwell in semi obscurity only issuing from their huts to plant arrows in the sides of the sleek town dwellers if it werent so ugly it might be picturesque or is it merely that the body resents much use of the brain monday october l found lytton with a swollen finger or spots on his hand sitting over the fire only moving when enveloped in a silk tablecloth wrapping his hand also in silk handkerchiefs complaining of the cold describing nights of agony when a pain like toothache seizes upon him develops into frantic agonies only to be allayed by morphia this has been going on for a month carrington is at her wits end very naturally anything like pain is abhorrent to all stracheys but making all allowances for the exaggerations terrors of the poor creature he has had a sufficient dose of horror i imagine the doctor privately warns carrington that shingles may last months however lytton is probably moving in to mary in a day or two avoiding london because of the influenzawe are by the way in the midst of a plague unmatched since the black death according to the times who seem to tremble lest it may seize upon lord northcliffe thus precipitate us into peace but i am far from peace a fortnight ago all bloomsbury rang with my crimes mh was conveyed about london in a fainting condition in taxicabs lytton was appealed to come to her rescue duncan clive vanessaall were in agonies desperations why no one charged me with it then i dont know my private theory is that clive inspired vs letter as a precaution against further indiscretions giving strict orders that his name should not be mentioned i soothed myself by denouncing the spy system now am quite unable even to feel irritated it all comes so i think from the indiscreet way in which people like mh accept positions which they are unable to fill thus flinching shying constantly keep everybody in a state of discomfort i announce my intention to keep clear of that set in future as i write this the post brings a letter from eliot asking to come see us to my great surprise a voice upon the telephone developed into the voice of lady mary murray asking us to lunch yesterday we changed lunch to tea went off to mores gardens a block of flats on the embankment where after ringing for some time a gigantic knock was answered by lady mary in person l was half inclined to think her an untidy but cordial housemaid the fisher williams were there a tea party is the least natural of situations produces the utmost amount of discomfort i think then the fws possessed only the brain of one moderate sized rabbit between them still it was the respectability that weighed me down not the absence of intellect there are certain dun coloured misty days in autumn which remind me of the murrays atmosphere the cleanliness of gilbert was remarkable a great nurse must rub him smooth with pumice stone every morning he is so discreet so sensitive so low in tone k immaculate in taste that you hardly understand how he has the boldness to beget children she is a wispy elderly lady highly nervous a little off hand much of an aristocrat in her dashing method kindly fussy refined tooo yes they are all refined i sat talked to gilbert first about our love of sweets then about the greek love of wine then about his standing with the government he has he says refused many honours but was reprimanded for sending a review of a book on job to america maliciously enough i felt that his simplicity was maintained in the face of years of worship adulation that the proper thing to say is how wonderfully simple dear gilbert murray is but his niceness was unmeasured the toynbees came in i had a long rigmarole with arnold about his office his learning so forth i think i frighten him or perhaps im not used to the oxford manner its suavity politeness are strange to me he is so shortsighted that he has a painful look of pinkness round the eyes as if he were a grammar school boy exalted by the most assiduous industry to positions above his station im always surprised to find how well meaning even outspoken he is in spite of this home to find freda major marooned at the station so that l had to fetch her herbert came after a field day hed been out since took f home k caught the last train to staines freda is merely a toy dog enveloped in human flesh but retaining the pretty plaintive rather peevish ways of her canine existence she has stimulated herbert to talk with greater fluency k enthusiasm than usual about the policeman strike k fords motor cars wednesday october just in from a walk in the park on this incredibly lovely autumn day various houses have orange berries growing upon them the beech trees are so bright that everything looks pale after you have looked at them how i dislike writing directly after reading mrs h wardshe is as great a menace to health of mind as influenza to the body we talked of peace how the sausage balloons will be hauled down k gold coins dribble in k how people will soon forget all about the war k the fruits of our victory will grow as dusty as ornaments under glass cases in lodging house drawing rooms how often will the good people of richmond rejoice to think that liberty has been won for the good people of potsdam i can believe though that we shall be more arrogant about our own virtues the times still talks ofthe possibility of another season in order to carry the war into germany k there imprint a respect for liberty in the german peasants i think the distance of the average person from feelings of this sort is the only safeguard assurance that we shall settle down again neither better nor worse we had a day in london yesterday ending for me in talks with ka james at the club which now renews its life apparently ka has ceased to be a bureaucrat owing to wills illness shed power as a chestnut its husk remains untouched within james just back from cornwall where he had the influenza alix back too without having the influenza ready i suppose to begin her autumn campaign which oliver bets that she will win i here note that i bought my new battery on tues oct th so far of extreme brilliance sunday november on friday night i went up to dine with the arnold forsters partly i own to avoid mr seymour coxs lecture upon the secret treaties since i thought i knew already what mr seymour cocks would say ka will live just past the spectator office in the little semicircle of houses standing off the road but tolerably noisy nevertheless here he lived before his marriage he looked unusually small drawn pallid like a face seen under a gas lamp owing to his disease no longer young he reminds me rather of one of those old ladies who have yellow hair very pink cheeks but you can count their years in the way the flesh is drawn tight across the bone crinkled with very delicate fine lines his person manners are against him he makes an impression of being very sharp rather fretful acid i think all this is largely due to his peevish voice little angular body which he jerks about when he gets excited very little makes him emphatic nor did i like the pale acid decorations of the roomthe lavender walls the one white rose drooping against them nor did i like his niggled emotional picture of the downs there seemed a lack of warmth depth substance perhaps none of this very much matters his principles are those of the modern husbandfreedom independence for the wifeequal pleasures principles matter too ka will be happy with him we talked very briskly i dont think i should like his taste in books i dont like his slang or his admirations but i liked his excitement over the war office gazette i suspect he has an able excitable rather febrile mind which on principle has taken to painting pictures i could wager my own head full of brains that hell never paint a good one on saturday we had one of our hampstead afternoons l going to margaret i to janet ive done the same thing so often ive found her in that green distempered room with the ugly pictures how well i know the benevolent look of the late mr case as a young man drawn upon yellow paper very slightly tinted on the cheeks larger than life framed in gold by the late mr richmond i know the photographs of young soldiers the silhouettes janets books which never seem to be read the greek dictionary with the piece of paper sticking out of it then theres diana who takes up a lot of attention but is now a reformed character emphie vagulates in out of the room tea is prepared i am pressed to eat more of everything questioned about butter coal yesterday emphie had a new kind of methylated spirits to show me which you can only get in highgate mr marshall rather varied the proceedingsa well kept middle aged gentleman of hampstead who proclaimed his wish to rule the world his fear lest america should rule it instead here was a times leading article in the flesh but he was also a chatty old gossip he emphie had noticed so many houses unlit newcomers who were almost unknown trees that wanted lopping motor cars waiting for mr galsworthy preparations for opening the ymca that it was like cranford to listen and then they went janet talked to me about literature i fell into a passing gloom she says that a great many novels are written it seems fairly evident that none are immortal i suppose i referred this to my own novels indeed she urged me to write a biography for basil williams but i fancy that what depressed me was not only the personal question but the smell of musty morality none of us came up to the scratchnot lytton or forster or anyone but i felt beyond this fairly safe criticism the depressing effect of talking to some one who seems to want all literature to go into the pulpit who makes it all infinitely worthy safe respectable i was led into trying to define my own particular searchnot after morality or beauty or realityno but after literature itself this made janet a little anxious insistent as if conceivably she might have missed something where did i find it how did i explain it we agreed upon a certain passage in sophocles but as she capped this with one in lear i think we were talking of different things and she pressed me to tell her what i meant of course i came nowhere near it k at length she said that she thought she was beginning to find what i meantafter all these years of reading greek yes i was depressed at her age at something unstable about her but i was also depressed at the implied criticism of the voyage out at the hint that i had better turn to something other than fiction now this seems to me foolish i wish i could make up a cure for it to be taken after such encounters which are bound to happen every month of ones life its the curse of a writers life to want praise so much be so cast down by blame or indifference the only sensible course is to remember that writing is after all what one does best that any other work would seem to me a waste of life that on the whole i get infinite pleasure from it that i make one hundred pounds a year that some people like what i write but janet would only admit that love counted said that her friends had succeeded only in coming off in life not in art monday november since im back from the club waiting for l who has gone to see mr hawkins of the temple unidentified i had better assuage my fretfulness with pen ink i have a pen of malachite vulcanite which perhaps serves the purpose of a babies coral ive had no letter from charleston which makes me feel rather sent to coventry though i suppose communications are going on between clive mary then i cant help fancying that janets chill falling upon the last pages of my novel still depresses me the depression however now takes the wholesome form of feeling perfectly certain that nothing i can do matters so that one is both content irresponsibleim not sure that this isnt a happier state than the exalted state of the newly praised at least one has nothing to fear the sheer pleasure of writing seems singularly unalloyed it proves itself so genuine that no amount of hampstead cold water can impair it praise fame janets good opinion how beside the mark they all are i keep thinking of different ways to manage my scenes conceiving endless possibilities seeing life as i walk about the streets an immense opaque block of material to be conveyed by me into its equivalent of language lotties fire has to be nursed like a dying kittenits my fire now hers being dead of course ive taken minutes to get a trickle of flame between the coals in the intervals ive been thinking a good deal about this melancholy state of impending age from the way janet took certain remarks of mine about as an age limit for the webbs i felt that she took age to be a shameful disease that one shrank from hearing named at anyrate it is obvious that she must think about it privately not facing it turning away from it and then it seems as if she were now always playing for safety she has a kind of personal resentment against anyone like lytton for example who laughs at what she holds sacred she falls into the insidious trap of believing that any departure from the great is ephemeral k impertinent k she argues this with personal feeling as if her own reputation depended on theirs and all the time shes so anxious to be in the front to share what the young feel but if i represent the young my feelings tend to develop on such different lines that i can only wave my hand over leagues of sea to souhamis mudies k the club saturday november lord mayors day among other things k one of the two last of war i suppose its just possible that lottie may bring us news that the armistice is signed within an hour people buy papers at a great rate but except for an occasional buzz round a newspaper boy k a number of shop girls provided with the evening news in the train one feels nothing different in the atmosphere the general state perhaps is one of dazed surfeit here weve had one great relief after another you hear the paper boys calling out that turkey has surrendered or austria given up k the mind doesnt do very much with it was the whole thing too remote k meaningless to come home to one either in action or in ceasing to act katherine murry whom i saw on wednesday inclines to think that most people have grasped neither war nor peace two or three weeks ago i heard a citizen holding forth to a lady in the train who asked him whether he thought there would be peace i hope not were giving them everything they want k getting nothing since then it is difficult to see how the most bloodthirsty citizens can squeeze anything more out of germany the kaiser still wears a phantom kind of crown otherwise there is revolution k a kind of partial awakenment one fancies on the part of the people to the unreality of the whole affair suppose we wake up too we began to set up kew gardens this weekthursday was the first day of it i think macdermott has surrendered his after a little ineffective shuffling on wednesday i went up to hampstead found the tall ugly villa looking over the valley where the murrys live katherine was up but husky feeble crawling about the room like an old woman how far she is ill one cant say she impresses one a little unfavourably at firstthen more favourably i think she has a kind of childlikeness somewhere which has been much disfigured but still exists illness she said breaks down ones privacy so that one cant write the long story she has written breathes nothing but hate murry the monster lm watch wait on her till she hates them both she trusts no one she finds no reality monday november twentyfive minutes ago the guns went off announcing peace a siren hooted on the river they are hooting still a few people ran to look out of windows the rooks wheeled round were for a moment the symbolic look of creatures performing some ceremony partly of thanksgiving partly of valediction over the grave a very cloudy still day the smoke toppling over heavily towards the east that too wearing for a moment a look of something floating waving drooping we looked out of the window saw the housepainter give one look at the sky go on with his job the old man toddling along the street carrying a bag out of which a large loaf protruded closely followed by his mongrel dog so far neither bells nor flags but the wailing of sirens intermittent guns tuesday november we should have done well i think to be satisfied with the aspect of peace how the rooks flew slowly in circles k the smoke drooped but i had to go to harrison i think we were both conscious ofa restlessness which made it seem natural to be going up to london disillusionment began after io minutes in the train a fat slovenly woman in black velvet feathers with the bad teeth of the poor insisted upon shaking hands with two soldiers its thanks to you boys c c she was half drunk already soon produced a large bottle of beer which she made them drink of then she kissed them the last we saw of her was as she ran alongside the train waving her hand to the two stolid soldiers but she her like possessed london alone celebrated peace in their sordid way staggering up the muddy pavements in the rain decked with flags themselves voluble at sight of other peoples flags the heavens disapproved did their utmost to extinguish but only succeeded in making feathers flop flags languish taxicabs were crowded with whole families grandmothers babies showing off yet there was no centre no form for all this wandering emotion to take the crowds had nowhere to go nothing to do they were in the state of children with too long a holiday perhaps the respectable suppressed what joy they felt there seemed to be no mean between tipsy ribaldry rather sour disapproval besides the discomfort tried every ones temper it took us from to to get home standing in queues every one wet many shops shut no light yet procurable in everyones mind the same restlessness inability to settle down yet discontent with whatever it was possible to do end of book the next portion of the diary including the entries for and january is written at the other end of a hardbacked exercise book which vw had begun to use in january for notes on books she was reading or reviewing diary vi friday november ive no money to buy another book besides by waiting the paper question may once more take its place in the scale of my pleasures good books cheap books books that make one wish to finish them in order to have the pleasure of buying another may be built up against the wall in stationers shops peace is rapidly dissolving into the light of common day you can go to london without meeting more than two drunk soldiers only an occasional crowd blocks the street in a day or two it will be impossible for a private to threaten to knock out the brains of an officer as i saw done the other day in shaftesbury avenue but mentally the change is marked too instead of feeling all day going home through dark streets that the whole people willing or not were concentrated on a single point one feels now that the whole bunch has burst asunder flown off with the utmost vigour in different directions we are once more a nation of individuals some people care for football others for racing others for dancing others foroh well theyre all running about very gaily getting out of their uniforms taking up their private affairs again coming home from the club tonight i thought for a moment that it must still be sunset owing to the sharp bright lights in piccadilly circus the streets are crowded with people quite at their ease the shops blazoning unshaded lights yet its depressing too we have stretched our minds to consider something universal at any rate we contract them at once to the squabbles of lloyd george a general election the papers are unreadable ones sense of perspective is so changed that one cannot see at first what meaning all this gossip of parties can possibly have one cant be interested other people have more right to be sluggish than i have one predicts a year or two of laxity save on the part of the professionals they will have things their own way masses will play football cricket take shooting in the country the first effect of peace on our circle is to set desmond loose to bring gerald shove up to london saying that he must find a way of making a year before long the crowd of out of work intellectuals looking for places will be considerable desmond is doing what he knows how to do supremely wellgoing later later to the office every day taking longer for lunch sometimes not going back again this he proposes to continue for a fortnight then to fold up his blue gold coat for everunless by cutting off the brass buttons he can make it do for an ordinary coat his spirits are very high though depressed occasionally by the question of earning a living it came out that he means to suggest himself for solomon eagles place on the new statesman for the eagle is flying higher i know so many people who write well he said if that were all he would make a perfect editor after tea he told us the last section of the ireniad i suppose it would fill a book from start to finish it ended characteristically with his promising to go to lunch waiting eleven years before he saw her again the story brought her back very plainly perhaps his conclusion was right one ought to pity any woman who is engaged to a young cambridge man who has never been in love beforea young cambridge man i should add who has read has by heart all the novels of henry james i was interrupted somewhere on this page by the arrival of mr eliot mr eliot is well expressed by his namea polished cultivated elaborate young american talking so slow that each word seems to have special finish allotted it but beneath the surface it is fairly evident that he is very intellectual intolerant with strong views of his own a poetic creed im sorry to say that this sets up ezra pound wyndham lewis as great poets or in the current phrase very interesting writers he admires mr joyce immensely he produced or poems for us to look atthe fruit of two years since he works all day in a bank in his reasonable way thinks regular work good for people of nervous constitutions ijbecame more or less conscious of a very intricate highly organised framework of poetic belief owing to his caution his excessive care in the use of language we did not discover much about it i think he believes in living phrases their difference from dead ones in writing with extreme care in observing all syntax grammar so making this new poetry flower on the stem of the oldest as an illustration of eliots views i may add what desmond has just thursday st nov told me d asked him how on earth he came to add that remark at the end of a poem on his aunt the boston evening transcript that phrase about an infinitely long street i like la rochefoucauld saying good bye or words to that effect eliot replied that they were a recollection of dantes purgatorio thursday z november i am overwhelmed with things that i ought to have written about peace dropped like a great stone into my pool k the eddies are still rippling out to the further bank has nelly cecil sunk beyond recall that concert at shelley house presided over so appropriately by bruce richmond for the sake of the good report of my diary let me record the fact that nelly cecil met the kaiser at hatfield said he appeared a small man in a grey suit his people were afraid of him they were afraid to tell him if his motor car was late he was romanticvery romantic too much space would be needed for an accurate description of shelley house briefly speaking it is a luxurious sham in imitation of the th century but as people like the st john hornbys never put all their eggs in one basket the italian renaissance is represented too i should guess arthur hughes shows that they patronise english art but mainly they put their faith in george the third how much the annual income of the audience amounted to i should not like to guess they wore a substantial part of it on their backs the furs were richly dark the stuffs of the best black and then the lovely music offered up before this congregationamong whom as they say i noticed mrs rathbone pearsall smith hervey vaughan williams mrs muir mackenzie however peace came dissipated all that now where are we according to roger on the brink of revolution this is strictly speaking according to ray ray who is standing for parliament as a coalition candidate says that if ever she were tempted to hoard food now would be the time the lower classes are bitter impatient powerful of course lacking in reason for example they demand houses with io rooms at guildford they have a prophet ditcher by name who knows the truth he knows what the brain is made of he has no use for the middle class idealism which cherishes doubts about some matters preaches liberty toleration other humbug for ditcher knows the truth these are a few facts that i gathered from roger over a dish of tripe leeks i cheered him a little by reminding him of the existence of football of king george how they crowdmy july the woolfs had been to tea with lady robert on sunday io november and went on with her to a quartet concert at shelley house no chelsea embankment the home of st john hornby printer connoisseur and partner in w h smith son this appears to have been one of a series of private subscription concerts organised by bruce richmond memories of the past week mention of king george recalls harry stephen who sat like a frog with his legs akimbo opening shutting his large knife asserting with an egoism proper to all stephens that he knew how to behave himself k how other people ought to behave which science he taught with success according to him upon the bench at calcutta he has need ofthe royal family he wants someone descended from egbert upon the throne not a schoolmaster like wilson the impenetrable wall of the middle class conservative was never more stolid dynamite may smash it to powder butit is impervious to reason or imagination or humanity an educated version of the prophet ditcher poor james strachey was soft as moss lethargic as an earthworm james billed at the club to lecture on onanism proposes to earn his living as an exponent of freud in harley street for one thing you can dispense with a degree but the real news of the past week is of a confidential nature gilbert murray has asked l to be his secretary if as is possible he is chosen to represent england on the league of nations committee at the peace conference this would mean a visit to paris more than this need not be said but it is an important possibility coming after it the news that i today wrote the last words of my novel reads a little flat five hundred thirty eight pages saturday november i see ive been rather slack i cant remember now exactly whats made me slack certainly not the general election ive reduced my reading of newspapers though the daily news has an extra sheet they somehow keep it up mrs dacre fox bellows in the high st mcdermott demands a government which will make the germans pay he prints poster after poster in red ink ive a new niece judith not welcomed but made the best of barbara has a judith too saxon dined here talking of death without enthusiasm he knew for certain that he would die on a certain day last summer thendidnt one night we went to the russian dancers it was incongruous enough to see what they offered the tolerant good tempered public who had been bellowing like bulls over the efforts of a man to nail a carpet down they were tolerant but as i fancied a little bit contemptuous of all this posing springing against a flat blue wall what a queer fate it isalways to be the spectator of the public never part of it this is part of the reason why i go weekly to see km up at hampstead for there at any rate we make a public of two on thursday murry came in we had an awkward interesting talk too self conscious to be enkindling i think something or other is a little inharmonious in both of themin my arrogance i suppose i feel them both too much of the underworld with all sorts of nostrums of their own all this talk about being artists i dont express what i mean perhaps all i mean is that they seem suspicious beneath the surface i expect that they are both very anxious for appreciation not at all sure of themselves murry wrings his brains dry becomes more more hopeless of finding anything to believe in i dont like married couples where the husband admires the wifes work immensely arthur ponsonby came up spoke to us at the club the other day he is standing somewhere wants to get in if only to prove that his side has a good case he said he didnt much care to be in parliament itself a weak moderately intelligent kindly man permanently puzzled worried too by the strange order of the world living in a social class different from the one he was born into may account for this then we had dr leys to lunch on wednesday th i put in by way of mark he has spent years in east africa being a very sterling direct scotchman has a terrible tale to tell about the natives how they concentrate how bare of superfluity they are these professional intellectual men printing off on our little machine began today now i must give my very best attention to murrys manuscript a fable for critics which i brought home in my bag with a view to printing tuesday j december what odd stray of knowledge makes me think that this is carlyles birthday perhaps because im reading about froudei go on to wonder whether any one else is thinking of carlyles birthday if so whether it gives him any pleasure again of the curious superstition haunting literary people ofthe value of being remembered by posterity but i had better rein myself in i have to read for a second time murrys poem which i found hard to read from reasons the opposite of those that make eliot hard to read murry has a plethora of words his poem is intricate involved as thick as a briar hedge he does his thinking aloud not making you fetch it from the depths of silence as eliot does weve been walking by the river indeed sitting beside it so hot it is bland milky without thrill in the air the gulls were letting themselves be carried down stream for a diversion i suppose little companies of three four gliding down then one dives reappears we discussed the origin of my present fit of melancholy i was divinely reassured by l so that here i sit comfortable secure once more established in that degree of belief which makes life possible but i leave out the analysis which i have gone into sufficiently i fancy all people have these spiritual tides in them heaven knows why altogether the more one thinks of it the stranger ones own organisation appears on sunday that is the ist december we had a dinner party six people make a dinner party they destroy private conversation you have to be festive we had nick carrington mrs manus sanger i think it was a successful party we were sufficiently springy spontaneous i think charlie made his little jokes nick was nearly silent but appreciative i foresee a testy middle age for nick mrs manus enjoyed her dinner carrington has more merit than most of the young we had chairs down and abolished the sofa i cant for the life of me remember what we talked about save that charlie emphatically despised both herbert fisher gilbert murray he doesnt like to be asked to meet people because theyre interesting he said i said no you only like failures on monday i went first to harrisons with l then walked across regents park had tea with barbara regents park at on a december afternoon is a dreary place so many purple leaves seem to be flattened on the path then the park keepers begin whistling i remember being afraid of being shut in as a child then the mist rolls up over that vast open space on one side of you the commoner animals in the zoo grunt k growlchiefly pigs now for war purposes i suppose this did not produce a cheerful frame of mind in which to visit an invalid to my horror i found that she shares a room with another a widow whose husband was killed there poor woman she sat pretending to read a book not to look my way while barbara i gossiped without much spirit b would have preferred a son sons she says are more troublesome nervous naughty from birth i suppose this is the natural feeling though not a very desirable one assertiveness seems to her interesting her own baby with nicks nose slept in a cradle grumbling a little but very good she said the future seemed to oppress her saturday december for some reason not connected with my virtues i think i get or even books weekly from the times thus breast one short choppy wave after another it fills up the time while night day lies dormant it gives me distinct pleasure i own to formulate rapid views of henry james mr hergesheimer chiefly because i slip in some ancient crank of mine but this sort of writing is always done against time however much time i may have for example here i have spent the week but i was interrupted days one cut short by a lunch with roger over hakluyt who turns out on mature inspection to justify over over again my youthful discrimination i write write i am rung up told to stop writing review must be had on friday i typewrite till the messenger from the times appears i correct the pages in my bedroom with him sitting over the fire here a christmas number not at all to mr richmonds taste he said very unlike the supplement style gift books i suppose i suggested o no mrs woolf its for the advertisers but to retrace on thursday i lunched with roger in order to hear the following story mrs mccoll to mr cox of the london library have you the voyage out by virginia woolf virginia woolf let me see she was a miss stephen daughter of sir leslie her sister is mrs clive bell i think ah strange to see whats become of those two girls brought up in such a nice home too but then they were never baptised roger i get on very well now more genuine free than we were under the shadow of gordon square we agree on many points he at least perceives the isolation of our little group in the large hostile world of mac colls duckworths then we discuss prose as usual some book is had out i have to read a passage over his shoulder theories are fabricated pictures stood on chairs here i become rather random desperate wolfe brings in a picture the question is about a slice of green on the midmost apple does it interpose with the violet on the edge of the potato cut it out see the way the colours show up over therewell try varnish then i think its the best thing ive done yet o yes theres more life in itits very strong wolfe very strong at last inevitably late i go on to the club where mrs manus l sit in the upper room correcting proofs but couch printer has only sent a batch anyhow i was too late to help but not to pour out tea for miss matthaie why should a woman of her sense apologise all her life long because she is an unattractive woman she looks up sidelong like a child who has done wrong and yet she has more in her head than all the cropheads put together alix i found intoning pompously downstairs with a perverted likeness to a colonel of the upper classes holding forth upon the iniquity of bolshevism her theme is the iniquity of colonels the method seems much the same even the voice friday as i say was spent writing by me by leonard in having lunch with will af correcting more proofs no sooner had i done a little type setting ruled off the hour a half before dinner in which to read my distinguished american novelist hergesheimer recommended by mr galsworthy than lottie admitted sydney waterlow my only hope for passing the time was some sort of introspective confidence on his part but no such luck he is prosperous complacent self assured even to the extent of confronting the disapproval of gordon square unabashed he is now on the round of his friends not he was careful to explain in order to test us but to enjoy our society mary sheepshanks had been summoned to dine with us in order to discuss the review macdonalds treachery paler perhaps thinner fading into middle age imperceptibly with the same flavour of bitterness against a worlda world of upper class women it is at the present moment who ask for an indemnity yet compared with the greater variety of my acquaintance she comes out abler better informed more rational than i remembered her in the days of fitzroy square but still she accepts her nice evening as the grudging poor accept a charity which is rather less than they deserve tuesday io december sunday was memorable to me for another visit to shelley house where i actually shook hands with miss sands katie elena rathbone all expressed great surprise at seeing me as if i were a strange bird joining a flock of the same species i felt strange enough but oddly familiar with their ways after the first elena was almost like an old friend a very old friend who persists remembering what went on before i took my dive she hers she pressed me almost affectionately to come see them i shall do it with misgivings suppose we have absolutely nothing to say all her charming frank caressing manner may vanish and then there is the eternal insoluble question of clothes katie rather ensanguined flesh covered but with a great dignity amplitude of feature sitting very up right eyes half closed in the front of the room listening to ravel schumann which she said she admired equally on monday i paid what has now become my weekly visit to katherine murry was there which makes it a little stiff though i like them both her better as a wife he scarcely speaks makes one feel that most speaking is useless but as he has a brain of his own i dont mind this besides it is more shyness than purpose i told such stories as i could think of murry then explained that he had a confession to make it only amounted to the fact that he has bought his brother a hand press upon which some short poems of his are to be printed beautifully like kelmscott books arthur is learning at a polytechnic wishes to do art printing i rather suspect arthurs views of art but anyhow we are to do what we like with murrys long poem at present to give it mcdermott seems the most feasible plan when the great red posters are all issued which have begun to paper richmond during the past few days payment punishment some other p is the policy they advocate we shall probably vote for no one a wet day but we went out having practically finished kew gardens i mean it is all ready to print save a few lines light in my study gives out about now i shall try to do a few lines of eliot before we go away there is one of the usual kitchen intrigues to have liz children to asheham for christmas nelly doesnt like to ask me lottie makes up a rigmarole about saving us expense this being the last time that she will be able to leave home how terrible it is to be in this position to other grown people monday december back from a week end with roger lips therefore rather sore with talk though his range is so wide we both have such a number of things to say that i certainly was neither bored nor satiated pamela was there very rounded supple with a likeness to some naked wood creature in an italian picture she has the yellow brown complexion too i suspect that children take the shape of their parents the other way about a vivacious sociable enthusiastic father produces a quiet unselfish rather passive daughter she is only sixteen but mature in manner as the result of living with grown up people it was polling day on saturday in guildford as in other parts of the world roger very gloomy about the future of the world no doubt he will soon forget about politics the war is already almost forgotten all sunday in spite of rain fog he painted till the sky was black having been grey through the time of daylight i feel little hope about his pictures but had to counterfeit an opinion as to the effect produced on the solidity of a bowl by a mornings work on it he said that he grudged every hour of daylight spent not painting since age draws near he must say what he wants to say before he dies age he proposes to spend alone working all day long at last he seems to do what he has always tried to do we had some melancholy revelations about the treachery of certain friends towards the omega rogers great point is that though superficially unbalanced exaggerated his sense of balance is always right in the end he is always magnanimous forgiving however much weight he may lay upon imaginary or semiimaginary grievances the omega case is that his artists accept commissions independently ofthe omega for that other reasons the poor shop has been a source of unmitigated disillusion to hima weariness grievance people hate art him for loving it is now a frequent burden of his talk nor did i show myself one of the elect with regard to painting at least we visited the national gallery together this morning i thought a rembrandt very fine which to him was mere melodrama a little ei greco conveyed little until he illumined it showed how it held more real colour than any other picture there then the ingres was repulsive to me to him one ofthe most marvellous of designs i always feel too that to like the wrong thing or fail in sufficiently liking the right jars on him like false notes or sentimentality in writing tuesday december this i cannot help fearing will be my last opportunity for writing before i go to asheham on friday though i shall continue there god being willing in some form of new book tomorrow i go to km thursday i have tea with the richmonds perhaps dine at the club so friday is reached without any interval between tea dinner even today i am stealing what belongs to sophocles before mrs hamilton arrives at to address the guild suppose i buy a block with detachable leaves i think i shall snare a greater number of loose thoughts no doubt this is pure fancy but then so much of ones mental affairs are controlled by fancy nessa has asked us to have the children for a fortnight when the new baby is born this is now imminent she fixes the th for the exact day the servants go to guildford for a week in order that we may be free from liz her offspring we shall have one week entirely alone at asheham the greatest most unmixed pleasure this world affords enhanced very much in my mind by the absence of servants so that often we are alone in the house i am going to read through my novel determine what to do with it ls book is almost done february will see it finished most likely we have printed off the text of kew gardens got an estimate from mcdermott for printing murrys poem he asks which to us seems little for copies ofa page book we supply the paper the cover possibilities are opened up i think weather has been so warm that i dont think ive had a fire in my study more than or times that only when we were printing in the afternoon influenza seems to be over though lottie had an attack lasting an hour or two on saturday iced cakes are possible but so far no more than that as for public news the war already seems an unimportant incident one of our political dodges at this moment the news boys are shouting that russia prepares for war it is difficult to see how even a jingo can now believe in any good from war or any ideal or anything one feels tempted to add undertaken by bodies of human beings in concert it is said that labour did well the coalition only moderately at the polls ray is said to have a good chancewe voted on saturday but l overcome with panic very likely voted for mrs dacre fox at the instigation of sidney webb lw in began the preparation ofa report on international trade for a committee of the labour research department in the summer of vw had helped by copying out relevant statistics from books and reports lent to lw by the library ofthe london school of economics lw later decided to restrict his study to africa and alix sargantflorence helped him with the research the book was finished in february but did not appear until the beginning of when it was published jointly by the labour research department and allen unwin under the title empire and commerce in africa a study in economic imperialism the bolsheviks had invaded esthonia capturing narva and british naval intervention was reported on december this proved overoptimistic the results ofthe poll on december declared on december showed an immense majority for the lloyd georgebonar law coalition seats out of labour secured mrs strachey polled votes as against the conservativeunionists and labours mrs dacre fox see above november n was the runnerup at richmond polling votes as against the conservativeunionists monday january i mean to copy this out when i can buy a book so i omit the flourishes proper to the new year it is not money this time that i lack but the capacity after a fortnight in bed to make the journey to fleet street even the muscles of my right hand feel as i imagine a servants hand to feel curiously enough i have the same stiffness in manipulating sentences though by rights i should be better equipped mentally now than i was a month ago the fortnight in bed was the result of having a tooth out being tired enough to get a headachea long dreary affair that receded advanced much like a mist on a january day one hours writing daily is my allowance for the next few weeks having hoarded it this morning i may spend part of it now since l is out i am much behindhand with the month of january i note however that this diary writing does not count as writing since i have just reread my years diary am much struck by the rapid haphazard gallop at which it swings along sometimes indeed jerking almost intolerably over the cobbles still if it were not written rather faster than the fastest typewriting if i stopped took thought it would never be written at all the advantage of the method is that it sweeps up accidentally several stray matters which i should exclude if i hesitated but which are the diamonds ofthe dustheap if virginia woolf at the age of when she sits down to build her memoirs out of these books is unable to make a phrase as it should be made i can only condole with her remind her of the existence of the fireplace where she has my leave to burn these pages to so many black films with red eyes in them but how i envy her the task i am preparing for her there is none i should like better already my th birthday next saturday is robbed of some of its terrors by the thought partly for the benefit of this elderly lady no subterfuge will then be possible is elderly though i anticipate her protest agree that it is not old partly to give the year a solid foundation i intend to spend the evenings of this week of captivity in making out an account of my friendships their present condition with some account of my friends characters to add an estimate of their work a forecast of their future works the lady of will be able to say how near to the truth i come but i have written enough for tonight only minutes i see to resume i admit i dont like thinking of the lady of courage however roger is past that age still capable of feeling enjoying playing a very considerable part in life wednesday january today is wednesday jan nd two days more were spent in bed k today counts as my first of complete health i even wrote a sentence of alterations and additions this morning i have a book on meredith to do for the times we walked this afternoon so i am back again nearly in my old position as i cant get up to london only see little framed pictures of alix fredegond sitting by the fire here i might attempt that solid foundation which i think desirable how many friends have i got theres lytton desmond saxon they belong to the cambridge stage of life very intellectual cut free from hyde park gate connected with thoby but i cant put them in order for there are too many ka rupert duncan for example all come rather later they belong to fitzroy days the oliviers k all that set are stamped as the time of brunswick sqre clive i put a little aside later still there are the cropheads alixcarrington barbara nick bunny i must insert too the set that runs parallel but does not mix distinguished by their social k political character headed perhaps by margaret k including people like goldie mrs hamilton k intermittent figures such as matthaei hobson the webbsno i cant include either the darkies or dr leys though they stand for the occasional visitor who lunches k retires to ls room to talk seriously i have not placed ottoline or roger k again there are katherine k murry k the latest of all hope mirrlees who recalls pernel k pippa k outlying figures such as ray k oliver gertler i must omit k mary hutch too for reasons which if my account gets written i might give k eliot i liked on the strength of one visit k shall probably see more of owing to his poems which we began today to set up this is a very partial account but i shall never place half of them accurately unless i start straight away lytton k desmond k saxon then well i cherish a considerable friendship for each of them the worst of it is how seldom we meet with lytton k desmond till last month tethered to a stool in the admiralty months pass without a sight of them the season of letter writing is over for all of us i think or perhaps we need different correspondents brilliant letters we wrote each other once partly for the sake of being brilliant k we were getting to know each other then k there was a thrill about it i speak of my own feelings but when we do meet there is nothing to complain of lytton is said to be more tolerant k less witty desmond they say needs a glass of wine saxon has his rheumatics k his hopeless love affair lytton again is famous these last six months but as that was a matter of course since his first six months there is not much surprise or change in it moreover i hear he has abandoned his asquiths or they are provided with some later light nothing is easier or more intimate than a talk with lytton if he is less witty he is more humane presumably judging from precedent k taking into account the demobilisation of the army he is now preparing to fly but as his alliance is not with me the direction he flies in makes very little difference i like carrington though she has increased his benignity o yes if he were to walk in at this moment we should talk about books k feelings k life k the rest of it as freely as we ever did k with the sense on both sides i think of having hoarded for this precise moment a great deal peculiarly fit for the other friday january oddly enough the day after writing this sentence i got into touch with lytton after a lapse of six months or so on the telephone k he is to dine here next friday but to resume there are three words knocking about in my brain to use of stracheysa prosaic race lacking magnanimity shorn of atmosphere as these words have occurred automatically k will tease me till written down i daresay there is some truth in them all the unpleasantness that i wish to introduce into my portrait of lytton is contained in them as if in deep wells i shall only need one drop of this gall for his portrait but i fancy a tinge of the kind is perceptible in him too far more in james oliver k marjorie rogers version is that all except lady s lack generosity it is an air a vapour an indescribable taste of dust in the throat something tickling irritating as well as tingling stimulating but then one must combine with this a great variety of mental gifts gifts of characterhonesty loyalty intelligence of a spiritual order one might almost attribute what i mean in lyttons case at least to lack of physical warmth lack of creative power a failure of vitality warning him not to be spendthrift but to eke out his gifts parsimoniously tacitly assume his right to a superior share of comfort opulence in matters of emotion this has a slightly stingy appearance nor is he ever unthinkingly generous magnanimous risking himself mentally of course it produces that metallic conventionally brilliant style which prevents his writing from reaching to my judgment the first rate it lacks originality substance it is brilliant superbly brilliant journalism a supremely skilful rendering of the the old tune written down these words are too emphatic linear one should see them tempered combined with all those charming subtle brilliant qualities which compose his being in the flesh but when i think of a strachey i think of someone infinitely cautious elusive unadventurous to the common stock of our set they have added phrases standards witticisms but never any new departure never an omega a post impressionist movement nor even a country cottage a brunswick square or a printing press we stephens yes even clive with all his faults had the initiative the vitality to conceive carry our wishes into effect because we wished too strongly to be chilled by ridicule or checked by difficulty even in the matter of taking tidmarsh lytton had to be propelled from behind his way of life insofar as it is unconventional is so by the desire determination of carrington thursday january such is the cold today that i doubt whether i can go on with my disquisition on such a day one would need to be of solid emerald or ruby to burn with any flame not merely dissolve in grey atoms in the universal grey i saw no one in richmond high street who seemed to be burning with the intensity of ruby or emeraldpoor pinched women absolutely mastered by circumstances though i did hear one speak of going home to get tea ready which suggested the possibility of some individual life for her a child threw her hat into the area which i had to recover made a whole row of them laugh by tossing it up twice so that it fell into the area again then the poles require copies of the international review to be sent to paris here is nelly to say two servants may call in to see me about nessas place to my chronicle of lytton i can only add that he writes today to put us off being fled to tidmarsh since calve is ill cannot meet me at heinemanns what he should be doing with calve i dont know but the information thus vouchsafed suggestswell further speculations of mine upon fame jealousy vanity so forth which i wait a more congenial season to unfold owing to this incubus of my friends i have said nothing of a visit from alix from norton from fredegond nor traced some rather interesting revelations or developments which may bear fruit one of these days alix is thinking of taking a house in gordon sqre chiefly in order to live with james she said this as she announced it to lme saxon had some quality in it that for the moment made my blood run cold now to tune myself up i am going to shut mrs watts upon george frederic open the antigone of sophocles one secondi must note for future use the superb possibilities of freshwater for a comedy old cameron dressed in a blue dressing gown not going beyond his garden for years suddenly borrows his sons coat walks down to the sea then they decide to proceed to ceylon taking their coffins with them the last sight of aunt julia is on board ship presenting porters with large photographs of sir henry taylor the madonna in default of small change friday january here i solace my restlessness as usual upon returning from the club upon this book i visited the omega heard roger wheedling a fat german lady to buy stuff doing his best to be polite to mr powell an art gentleman who makes glass in south kensington i suppose can believe thence through streets of frozen mud snow slush slippery congealed into little knobs like those on an astrachan coat to the club here i am interrupted by the voice of my dear old friend desmond upon the telephone minutes discourse yes hes taking a house at oare perhaps wishes us to be near him will come on tuesday to bring a story is lodging at littlehampton will subscribe to the review send a flimsy for no of course theyve let wellington square propose to live cheap spend half the year in the country which he doesnt much like but there it is here with sympathetic enquiries about my health tooth we ring off yes its sympathy that desmond has thus im switched back again to old lytton but old lytton i must at once acquit of wishing to impress me with his calves his heinemanns i think he mentioned a concert this is it let me try to account for the fact that he has dominated why even the word is his a generation at cambridge make it square with my disparaging remarks how did he do it how is he so distinct unmistakable if he lacks orginality the t f h h rest s tnere any reputable escape from this impasse in saying that he is a great deal better than his books or am i too chary of praise for those books am i jealous do i compare the editions of eminent victorians with the one of the voyage out perhaps theres a hint of jealousy but if i underrate i think the main cause is that while i admire enjoy up to a point up to a point agree im not interested in what he writes thomas hardy has what i call an interesting mind so have conrad hudson but not lytton nor matthew arnold nor john addington symonds life is getting crowded out altogether but life hasnt been very enjoyable these last few days conceive a conspiracy of fog frost strike on tube railways on top of that servant hunting for nessa this last has ended disastrously i braved mrs abbey once more yesterday snatched my phoebe crane from the jaws of mistresses innumerable only to hear now that shes not wanted must be put off with a pound note to solace her this is the imposing pinnacle to my fortnights castle building with budge the rest the cards fall down things are as they were letters upon letters have been written in that bold hand business like style unnatural to me telegrams sent nelly entreated brains ransacked journeys of penitence made with the result that is nowscattered among undeserving people but i must record a little sunshine today less cold to balance that the district railway on strike desmond has not rung up that is quite a good preface to the description of his character the difficulty which faces one in writing of desmond is that one is almost forced to describe an irishman how he misses trains seems born without a rudder to drift wherever the current is strongest how he keeps hoping planning shuffles along paying his way by talking so enchantingly that editors forgive shopmen give him credit at least one distinguished peer leaves him a thousand in his will saturday february what a disgraceful lapse nothing added to my disquisition life allowed to waste like a tap left running eleven days unrecorded still i think if i were a painter i should only need a brush dipped in dun colour to give the tone of those eleven days i should draw it evenly across the entire canvas but painters lack subtlety there were points of light shades beneath the surface now i suppose undiscoverable the predominant tint was furnished by the need i was under of visiting registry offices in the coldest weather of the year it seems to me that i must have visited a dozen three was in truth the utmost but then one was on the verge of civilisation on the outskirts of fulham how hard contained disillusioned the eyes of the women at the desks become as if glued in front of them they saw eternally a cook of doubtful character they can scarcely draw a veil of politeness over them at the sight of me dressed up in red velvet fur for their benefit in the end somehow nelly had to go to charleston for a week phoebe crane recovered from her illness was despatched there so that peace is temporarily renewed yesterday friday i had one of my occasional galas dressed in my best i went to sickerts pictures which i here pronounce the pleasantest solidest most painterlike show in england there i met clive mary clive in his fur coat mary in the more subdued style of the new english art club put a yellow cane in clives hand hang a ribbon from an eyeglass he would step out of a sporting printno a caricature tinted with pinks yellows he introduced me to young nevinson with the prince albert whiskersmaking allusion to our both being such celebrated figures which nevinson did not appreciate later clive mary i strolled chattering like a perch of parrokeets to verreys with its blue paint gilt devices mary had a dutiful visit to pay her husband in hospital so we sat talked in an inner rooma pleasant dissipated place parquet floorcurved bar little tablesgreen gold nourishes dilapidated george the th style empty at this hour save for some dubious ladies we talked we vibrated in sympathy we billed cooed rosy lights shone on his cheeks our intercourse was very gay vibrant like that of stringed instruments duncan passed througha strange shaggy interlude but always k inevitably harmonious he blinked as if newly exposed to the light crumbled his brioche k gulped down his coffee stammering out his half articulated but immensely expressive words saying i remember how art letters was the dullest dreariest of papers ill show it youno its not in that pocketno i dont know where it is how julian quentin were so much cleverer than most children somehow too soon he hoisted himself into an astonishing long straight black coat like a nonconformist ministers hitched down his red waistcoat started off in a vague determined way to victoria station and then we sat on clive k i talking of writing of my writing chiefly which he praises sufficiently to give his strictures a good deal of force as i half suspected he found grave faults in that crude laborious novel of mine excessive merits in the mark the best prosehe said written in our day mary came in interrupted or rather influenced the current of our discourse for she hardly spoke then we turned out into regent street where the lamps were lit the shop opposite had all its windows full of bright clothes against a green stage scene so strolling in the spring twilight laughing still we made our way through soho i left them in a street with many jewellers windows tuesday february here i sit waiting for alix who cant be coming to disburden herself of confidences as i supposed thus my mind returns by way of her fickleness to my friends where was i desmond k how i find him sympathetic compared with stracheys it is true im not sure he hasnt the nicest nature of any of usthe nature one would soonest have chosen for ones own i dont think that he possesses any faults as a friend save that his friendship is so often sunk under a cloud of vagueness a sort of drifting vapour composed of times k seasons separates us k effectively prevents us from meeting perhaps such indolence implies a slackness of fibre in his affections toobut i scarcely feel that it arises rather from the consciousness which i find imaginative k attractive that things dont altogether matter somehow he is fundamentally sceptical yet which of us after all takes more trouble to do the sort of kindnesses that come his way who is more tolerant more appreciative more understanding of human nature it goes without saying that he is not an heroic character he finds pleasure too pleasant cushions too soft dallying too seductive k then as i sometimes feel now he has ceased to be ambitious his great work it may be philosophy or biography now k is certainly to be begun after a series of long walks this very spring only takes shape appears i believe in that hour between tea k dinner when so many things appear not merely possible but achieved comes the day light k desmond is contented to begin his article k plies his pen with a half humorous half melancholy recognition that such is his appointed life yet it is true k no one can deny it that he has the floating elements of something brilliant beautifulsome book of stories reflections studies scattered about in him for they show themselves indisputably in his talk im told he wants power that these fragments never combine into an argument that the disconnection of talk is kind to them but in a book they would drift hopelessly apart consciousness of this no doubt led him in his one finished book remnants to drudge k sweat until his fragments were clamped together in an indissoluble stodge i can see myself however going through his desk one of these days shaking out unfinished pages from between sheets of blotting paper deposits of old bills k making up a small book of table talk which shall appear as a proof to the younger generation that desmond was the most gifted of us all but why did he never do anything they will ask at any rate in his own intermittent way desmond is faithful so much one may affirm of saxon too who comes next on my list but saxons fidelity is almost that of the senile colly or broken down assthe pensioner who can draw upon a memory of the past for a seat at ones table in perpetuity his present condition makes him appear almost exclusively in the character of almoner he has little to give at the moment life has not been generous to him his possessions are old friendships old memories things weve talked of ages ago unlike the rest of us he has had no renewal of life in marriage his hopes in that direction have been crushed therefore he comes to me disconsolately grudgingly ungenerously were the cause not one beyond his reach asking rather than giving asking at this moment that i shall accept barbara at his handreturn her to him enriched with the glow of my approval and barbara does not appear to me somehow of that metalthat rarity however poor saxons life is now in the uncomfortable unbecoming season which is so painfully well reproduced out of doors sleet mud chill nothing growing no warmth no brilliancy not even a modest domestic glow he lodges with stagg in great ormond street has summed up his own position accurately as that of one who finds himself lonely if alone bored if in company but faithfulthere is something worth having in saxons fidelity something that makes his most meagre visitation not altogether fruitless one is aware even after two hours of tepid almost entire silence that he is strictly true genuine unalloyed you would never find him wanting never find him callous insincere or grudging the last farthing ofhis possessions granted that he is not richly supplied with the gifts one might need still i come to think in my weary age that safety a modest competencea truth as flawless as diamond or crystalis not negligible nor without its curious flashes of high remote beauty at any rate i rest on the thought of saxon with some relief after hovering for the past two months in a state of uncertainty over the thought of katherine murry i might turn round what i have written of saxon in order to make a background on which to paint a portrait of katherine it is at this moment extremely doubtful whether i have the right to class her among my friends quite possibly i shall never see her again upstairs i have letters in which she speaks of finding the thought of me a joy dwelling upon my writing with excitement i have letters making appointments pressing for visits adding postscripts of thanks affection to visits already paid but the last is dated december it is now february the question interests amuses also slightly no very decidedly pains me if it were not that i suspect her of wishing to produce precisely these emotions save that of amusement i should be still more put out as it iswell i should need to write a long description of her before i arrived at my queer balance of interest amusement annoyance the truth is i suppose that one of the conditions unexpressed but understood of our friendship has been precisely that it was almost entirely founded on quicksands it has been marked by curious slides arrests for months ive heard nothing of her then we have met again upon what has the appearance of solid ground we have been intimate intense perhaps rather than open but to me at anyrate our intercourse has been always interesting mingled with quite enough ofthe agreeable personal element to make one fondif that is the wordas well as curious i was at pains to go up to hampstead every week since mid october or november i suppose and then what happened i go away for christmas we send small bright presents carefully timed to arrive on christmas day i add to mine one if not two long affectionate letters i propose to come as soon as i get back my time in bed prevented this but meanwhile for no reason given or to be guessed at with any certainty she falls silent i get no thanks no answers no enquiries so suspecting but willing to make every test before coming to conclusions i asked murry whether she would like a visit to which he replied cordially without the shadow of hesitation i proposed to go yesterday about eleven she or rather the female who keeps house rang up put me off saying that km was too unwell for my visit but making no suggestion of another time nor have i any word from her or k this morning friday february but all this is made to appear rather fine drawn exaggerated by the simple fact that i have a letter this morning from km herself asking me to tea on monday explaining how some new treatment gives her fever for two days makes it impossible for her to see people also i am asked to write for the athenaeum so that little scratch in my vanity is healed not that i want to review any more books than come my way already but owing to my laborious it appears rather misleading accounts of my friends life has been too much neglected let me recollect on sunday last saxon barbara dined here but did little more than dine since she had to return to feed her baby she came frisking into the room but her mind is a sedate literal mind the pity is that she cant always be in a state of bodily frisk that is her natural element im sure to expect quiet talk is against nature saxon watches her judging i suppose that her charms provide for them both i let myself in for a visit to faiths a tea to see the baby faith will shortly add to the race herself a discontent is roused in me at this proceeding on her part im a human being myself i scarcely feel that faith will do us credit she is a lax satirical woman finding sharp things to say already at possessed of a grievance there she lounges over her fire arranging little mosaic patterns of all of us in a peevish way k making it appear that she has no other interest in life one feels her mind a very magpies larder of gossip oh yes she knew of my meeting with hope mirrlees informed me that she supposed i was one of those unstable friends rejoicing in quarrels she had apparently given the matter some thought in contrast to her barbara was very nice direct unaffected sympathetic as far as her wits will carry her in some queer fashion of her own a personality i wonder what this rises from on the doorstep in the dark she hinted her concern for poor old saxon and then saxon rang me up to apologise for not staying longer suggest another visit tuesday february well i havent even quarrelled with mirrleesmy literary ladies are faithful though intermittent whether purposely or not i dont undertake to say but these speculations obliterate what i see i call life the truth is i shirk the gigantic task of giving an account of sundays teaparty at which i met sir val chirrol sir henry newbolt lady lady cromer the bruce richmonds a scattering of gallant bald cavalry officers mounds of south kensington dowager respectability who must be nameless sir val katie both foretold a revolution seemed to picture themselves meeting death nobly for the principle of respectability at the hands ofthe russian jews russian jews invest every great citya people of enormous energy unscrupulosity then as sir val remarked will never come againnot that anyone could accuse me of pacifism meanwhile sir henry confessed that music especially the music of strings moves the fount of poetry in him something always comes ofa concertsomething will come this eveninghe assured me as a priest foretelling a miracle or a conjuror producing a rabbit but the amiability of south kensington is disarming a kind of modesty veils what is so prominent disagreeable in the intellectuals they have an air of saying i am no oneno one at all my only function is to be agreeable another cup of tea do for goodness sake take this arm chair let me fetch you a slice of bread butter thats my impression of the moment though for some reason it doesnt encourage one to say anything more interesting than thank you please dont trouble other phrases of the kind of no cromwell houses fronting the stuffed beasts quite capable of staring them out of countenance i will only say that it is furnished on the great south kensington principle of being on the safe side doing the thing handsomely good mrs samuel bruce went to the autotype company ordered the entire dutch school to be sent round framed in fumed oak and so they were just covered the staircase walls leaving an inch or twos margin in between the drawing roomno i cant write it all out memory preserves only the shoulders of a horse on a gilt easel three large seascapes like slabs of thick bread butter the company was decorous fur bearing as usual the music like the voice of spirits in another world enticing the hopelessly damned sir henry wrote a patriotic song to the tune of it but how nice they are tookatie shouldering her way along the streets afterwards letting fall sentences of curious remote force as though she were on top of a mountain or lost in a mist as i cant help feeling these aristocrats are not however lord eustace percy but at him my pen boggles since i cannot delve any further back into the week how modestly he started smoking his pipe like any commoner like poor rubber faced little ewer himself or wrynecked burns then by degrees how authoritative masterly he became k beat the table to make his points pulled his audience up short bade them wait a second or asked them well what do you suggest then what is your answer to that like some transcendent head master to whom the rest of us are but little children spelling out their lesson very badly stumbling over the long words lord eustace in his goodness undertakes to enlighten us i got the impression of a very able man k a very aristocratic man k a very nice mana combination that is so irresistable as to be alarming he explained the league of nations draft very well but now we come to another of the ornate k decorated tribe try as she will she can never lay aside her coronet i mean poor dear old ottoline we dined at gattis together last night i fetched her from the family bosom of garlands hotel she has the slim swaying figure ofa lombardy poplarthe ridges hollows of the cheeks are the only sign of her years i make them a feeble mincing step on the street like that of a cockatoo with bad claws she has an indomitable spirit plucking life out with those same gouty claws as if she were young had illusions by the score she had swooped down upon the land agents wife upon rosa allatinifor no reason save that the land agents wife writes novels rosa allatini has had her novel burnt by the hangman allatini was a bad choice save that she almost fainted had to be fed on bath buns which ottoline had by her confided of course the story of her unhappy love which made it necessary for her to be fed on bath buns birrell had been to tea remarking how queen victoria liked nothing better than the sight of a drunken man lopokova had been discoursing all the afternoon as we sat at dinner ott picked up scraps of talk from the other diners admired their profiles and so round to gordon square where we found clive at the top of the house where i used to stand write in the largest arm chair ever seen by the finest fire with a screen across the door to keep the draught out as affable as a cockatoo as brightly coloured as a macaw left them together lost my train wednesday march just back from days at asheham one at charleston i sit waiting for leonard to come in with a brain still running along the railway lines which unfits it for reading but oh dear what a lot ive got to read the entire works of mr james joyce wyndham lewis ezra pound so as to compare them with the entire works of dickens mrs gaskell besides that george eliot finally hardy and ive just done aunt anny on a really liberal scale yes since i wrote last she has died a week ago today to be precise at freshwater was buried up at hampstead yesterday where or years ago we saw richmond buried in a yellow fog i suppose my feeling for her is half moonshine or rather half reflected from other feelings father cared for her she goes down the last almost of that old th century hyde park gate world unlike most old ladies she showed very little anxiety to see one felt i sometimes think a little painfully at the sight of us as if wed gone far off k recalled unhappiness which she never liked to dwell on also unlike most old aunts she had the wits to feel how sharply we differed on current questions this perhaps gave her a sense hardly existing with her usual circle of age obsoleteness extinction for myself though she need have had no anxieties on this head since i admired her sincerely but still the generations certainly look very different ways two or perhaps three years ago l i went to see her found her much diminished in size wearing a feather boa round her neck and seated alone in a drawing room almost the copy on a smaller scale ofthe old drawing room the same subdued pleasant air ofthe th century old portraits old china she had our tea waiting for us her manner was a little distant more than a little melancholy i asked her about father she said how those young men laughed in a loud melancholy way how their generation was a very happy one but sel leased to maynard keynes in but clive retained accommodation there vw had had a high desk constructed at which she could stand to write in emulation of her sister who normally stood before her easel to paint fish how ours seemed to her fine but very terrible but we hadnt any writers such as they had some of them have just a touch of that quality bernard shaw has but only a touch the pleasant thing was to know them all as ordinary people not great men and then a story of carlyle father carlyle saying hed as soon wash his face in a dirty puddle as write journalism she put her hand down i remember into a bag or box standing behind the fire said she had a novel threequarters written but couldnt finish itnor do i suppose it ever was finished but ive said all i can say dressing it up a trifle rosily in the times tomorrow i have written to hester but how i doubt the sincerity of my own emotions asheham was i suppose a qualified success onlyat any rate for l because of the discomfort for me the discomfort such as it was was chiefly due to philip woolfs presence one couldnt sink back before the log fire read shakespeare that form of exalted egotism was checked i think perhaps philip felt himself a little ofa hindrance as no doubt he always feels himself nowan outsider a spectator unattached very lonely duncan came over involved in domestic difficulties gave him a letter to mr hecks the farmer which he was to deliver yesterday morning in the worst downpour of the year but we had two lovely afternoons of spring when i kept asking myself now where are we what point have we reached is this spring or september waking with a start to the fact that we are launched on another summer those little grey green tassels were decorating the woods like the design on a japanese screen starting out to fetch milk on one of these days we met gunn heard our fate were to go in september he wants asheham to live in with his old mother oh dear oh dear each time i walked up the drive i thought how nothing was ever so perfect if it werent for the devil of starting something new in me i should be in despair l thinks it easy to make a fetish of a house which is true meanwhile we hang suspended but the need of looking for another house is a source of great pleasure it drove us all along the rodmell road to mr staceys there we heard from a pair of drab females in a chaise that mr robinson of iford is going to let so on we went to iford a thickly set little village on the plain found a house with three green columns a stuffed up drawing room a mrs robinson made so l declared the number of her children attested for breeding purposes art lamps iridescent plates attached to the wall demonstrated the gentility of her farmer husband evidently they have made themselves very snug will want more than we can pay even if the country there were better than it is on the whole we incline to aim at itford farm housea house that could be made very attractive with its view its sun we have grown out of gentlemens houses charleston is by no means a gentlemans house i bicycled round there in a flood of rain found the baby asleep in its cot nessa duncan sitting over the fire with bottles bibs basins all round them duncan went to make my bed their staff at this moment consists simply of jenny the sharp jewish looking cook she having collapsed spent the afternoon in bed by extreme method unselfishness routine on nessas duncans parts chiefly the dinner is cooked innumerable refills of hotwater bottles baths supplied one has the feeling of living on the brink of a move in one of the little islands of comparative order duncan set up his canvas bunny wrote a novel in a set of copy books nessa scarcely leaves the babies room or if she appears for a moment outside she has instantly to go off talk to dan jennys young man the future support of charleston or to wash napkins or bottles or prepare meals mrs b the children run rapidly to fro between their rooms i had an immense long talk with ann brereton about the health ofthe persian cat which according to mrs b was fatally injured internally while being washed to cure it of nits so that she demanded chloroform which nessa refused the cat recovered then quentin had just been suspected of measles the atmosphere seems full of catastrophes which upset no one the atmosphere is good humoured lively as it tends to be after three months of domestic disaster in these circumstances i daresay i had no more than minutes consecutive talk with nessa chiefly devoted to the great epic ofthe dr the nurse emily but as happens after disaster upon disaster a sudden lightening of calamity appeared this morning dan his mother being engaged a letter then arrived from a nurse who against all probability seems to wish to come if she may bring a friend but i broke off in full tide k had to trudge through mud to glyndesuch mud that when i went into powell the land agent the sleek little clerk looked from my head to my boots in expostulationas if such a figure couldnt possibly require a house with bedrooms k a bathroom unhappily there seems little chance of finding one ive said nothing of my niece who must be called so formally since theyve cancelled susanna paula sc can think of nothing else she is a wistful patient contemplative little creature examining the fire very meditatively with a resigned expression k very large blue eyes i suppose not much larger than a big hare though perfectly formedlegs thighs fingers k toesboth fingers k toes very long k sensitive friday march having smashed my ink pot i have recourse to safety pots again k purple ink i see dwells in this one but i cant use with any effect the muffled respectability ofa fountain pen yesterday i had a tooth out to which the bag of a large abscess had attached itself harrison showed it me previous to putting it in the fire a token of much pain he said the queer little excursion into the dark world of gas always interests me i came home in the tube wondering whether any of the people there suspected its existence i wake from it or seem rather to step out of it k leave it to go on hurtling through space while the world of harrison k dr trueby engages my attention open your mouth mrs woolf now let me take out this little bit of wood suppose one woke instead to find the deity himself by ones side the christians believe it i suppose l has met an immense number of people these last few days k i should have told how sidney webb finds his book a most remarkable piece of work k how it is to be printed directly by clark of edinburgh k will be out perhaps by june and my poor old sluggard night k day is to be

satisfactorily my article according to br is received with acclamation in the office at home k in my club the richmonds want to take a house for april k maypossibly we may consider letting them asheham if i had ls experience i could here give a little story of the coal commission k lloyd george behind the scenes as reported by mrs webb wednesday march sunday was one of my shelley house afternoons there i met clive k in his company i was less than ever in touch with the gatheringas dusky furclad k discreet as ever though i fancy that i am less impressed by it all than i was k even take shelley house more or less as an ordinary house i had to talk to elena about asheham k find her so slow in her mind so accustomed i suppose to the position of an ornate k handsome ornament that she positively cant understand k scurries in her replies as if she were a fat spaniel crossing a busy road and her eyes are without depth clive gave me dinner at the cafe royal which did not much interest me as a show rather to his disappointment however towards the end of dinner a woman of doubtful character dining alone with a man threw her glass on the floor made a great rattle of knives k plates upset the mustard pot k marched out like an indignant turkey cock was this moment with the eyes ofthe diners upon her what repaid her was it for this that she protested anyhow she left her man very crestfallen trying to appear nonchalant i daresay that was what she wanted i couldnt help thinking of the dreary scene in the flat next morningthe tears the recriminations the reconciliationk next sunday theyll dine i suppose at another restaurant dining with clive now i always feel that we mark the change in our circumstances views our present is acted on a background of the past the present is more amiable considerably gayer than the past though not perhaps so interesting its interest is different rather for i was interested in what he told me of nessa r d in what i could guess of his own attitude so happy so vibrant so epicurean yet has he his moments not exactly of disillusionment but of feeling that things might have been rather on a larger scale i doubt it i fancy he has found his level hence his comfort on monday march i think we had a day of industry we are coming to the end of eliots poemsbut ive forgotten saturday when we had marjorie strachey k the shoves k saxon to dinner saxon like the sand in the oyster was the origin of the whole pearl we cannot quite face saxon alone had recourse to telephone telegraph to summon others i doubt that he likes this he wants more attention than one can give him in company he sits silent outside the magic circle no lure draws him in to me the most interesting object that evening was gumbo instantly undoubtingly i thought her changed she has come to some decision she has passed some stage doesnt conrad say that theres a shadow line between youth middle age well since i saw her last she has crossed it into the smoother greyer waters beyond she has just had notice to leave her school on account of her short sight in old days this would not have mattered much she would have been on with something new but when i spoke of her as the acrobat flying from trapeze to trapeze she shook her head no that is all over she now has her two rooms in kensington lives on her earnings comes home k is glad to be quiet there glad to find that her charwoman has lit the fire things havent turned out well joss fault i suppose the prospect is drearier than i could face in my own case i begin to see now how my friends lives are shaping it looks a little as if marjorie was to be one ofthe failuresnot that i rank marriage or success in a profession as success its an attitude of mind the way one looks at life i must notice that though the sky is as black as water one has washed ones hands in a bird is singing romantically k profusely at the window on our walk today we passed almond trees in full flower the daffodils are on the point of bursting but so far i doubt if weve had one day of blue sky or any heat nor is there any shadow at kew where the shade is universal last night miss fox aged perhaps earning her living living in rooms with a friend daughter of an oxford don k pippas secretary dined here k lectured the guild on equal pay leonard is preparing to dress for the first time since marriage in an assortment of clothes to dine with david davies k venizelos this morning we had notice to quit from hoper k the further blow that he will not let us have the itford farm saturday march today was to have been the happiest of the week k then among my letters was one from duncan which looked to me ominous k proved of course to contain a demand for nelly as soon as possible what else but a demand is it when he says that nessa is becoming completely knocked up by incessant work k responsibility so i have wired to say she will go if possible for weeks k the prelude to the wire was unpleasant k the postscript will be still more so for the moment this house represents a little island of refuge to the childbearers karin rang up last night to suggest that we should take ann judith k mabel for a fortnight which fortnight they are going to spend at asheham but no one can see how difficult it is to detach a cook or to take in children when ones organisation is framed on a different scalehowever its enough to live ones disagreeables without writing them moreover we refused to take mabel k ann k judith on thursday bruce k elena dined hererather an event but it went off peaceably enough they at least are well beyond the shadow line i found him mellower k milder k less spruce than i expected which pleased me in the admiring editor of my works as for elena her distinction in black with a jade jewel is undeniable her white hair too on the top of a face coloured like almond blossom k with all this stateliness k repose an air if i mistake not of melancholy as of hopes not realised k acquiescence accepted instead of something warmer which slightly touched me guessing the cause of it her notes are very few but she could discuss the indian bill with l k indian religions so that i daresay her slowness k apparent stupidity are only that she finds herself out of her element with me we talked much about asheham of course the evening passed quietly sedately with only one or two of those awkward pauses which i remember in their house he treats her rather as a large magnificent child o youll like that he said when i offered her a bulls eye she told me she had noticed a very nice sweetshop in the street i fancy that bruce is a kindly very unambitious man who has been quite pleased to spend his time in doing kindnesses to poverty stricken young men fitting the articles into the advertisements in the supplement which he says is not such as easy job as it looks when the great catastrophe happens he said alluding to lord northcliffe there is a walter who is going to buy back the times make it into a decent paper again they went down to see asheham on friday but the result is not yet known to us l is right i think in saying that elenas place ought to be in a big house in a village distributing alms i asked vaguely for a compositor she undertook very scrupulously to find me one being in touch of course with various organisations on friday i went to london had tea with mrs hamiltonmolly that is i had to correct myself half a dozen times l has now got into the habit of lunching in london twice a week so appeasing the gaping maws of green matthew murry is in the next room has asked l to do the social i mean social reform side of the atheneuam pressing upon him a large yellow book for review james strachey has extracted the post of dramatic critic eliot may be subeditor the first number comes out on april th these little bits of literary gossip strike me as slightly discreditable they point perhaps to ones becoming a professional a hack of the type of mrs w k clifford who used to know exactly what everyone was paid who wrote what ek all the rest of it i can see father listening with disapproval but secret enjoyment mrs hamilton made me feel a little professional for she had her table strewn with manuscripts a book open on the desk she began by asking me about my novel then we talked about reviewing i was interested to hear who had reviewed martin schtiler was a little ashamed of being interested she told me a curious thing about the sensibilities of my familyadrian had asked her to tell me how much hed liked the voyage out which he has just read for the first time is too shy to write tell me so himself she has or sisters all artists according to her though the designs for stained glass that i saw didnt seem to me to prove it one is a poet who surrounds herself with sketches of projected books on every conceivable subject has written a long poem which she wants us to consider publishing she is a poetcertainly a poet she said which roused my suspicions the truth is that molly hamilton with all her ability to think like a man her strong serviceable mind her independent selfrespecting life is not a writer but we exchanged the plots of our novels said how very interesting wednesday march life piles up so fast that i have no time to write out the equally fast rising mound of reflections which i always mark down as they rise to be inserted here i meant to write about the barnetts the peculiar repulsiveness of those who dabble their fingers self approvingly in the stuff of others souls the barnetts were at any rate plunged to the elbow red handed if ever philanthropists were which makes them good examples then unquestioning unspeculative as they were they give themselves away almost to the undoing of my critical faculty is it chiefly intellectual snobbery that makes me dislike themis it snobbery to feel outraged when she says then i came close to the great gatesor reflects that god good devil evil has this coarseness of grain any necessary connection with labour for ones kind and then the smug vigour of their selfsatisfaction never a question as to the right of what they doalways a kind of insensate forging ahead until naturally their undertakings are all of colossal size portentous prosperity moreover could any woman of humour or insight quote such paeans to her own genius perhaps the root of it all lies in the adulation of the uneducated the easy mastery of the will over the poor and more more i come to loathe any dominion of one over another any leadership any imposition of the will finally my literary taste is outraged by the smooth way in which the tale is made to unfold into full blown success like some profuse peony but i only scratch the surface of what i feel about these two stout volumes on monday after many failures i met murry at the club we had our talk about the athenaeum success has already begun to do for murry what i always said it would do he is more freshly coloured even in the cheeks than when we last met his mind has its high lights why he chuckled like a schoolboy his eyes shone his silences were occupied with pleasant thoughts i think not that he would admit that to edit the athenaeum was much more than preferable to a place in a government office he talked so much about his plans with such zest that we sat there from to or past i had to rush in fact i only caught my train owing to my skill as a psychologist we were discussing his poetry his standing as a poet with some intensity on his part so that he lay back looked very intently at the ceiling i was interested but guilty about dinner waiting so i said yes its true writing for ones own press is very pleasant now next week i have to take my novel to gerald duckworth ah his eyes came down from the ceiling at once whats it called oh yesitll be out in the autumn i suppose well dyou know im afraid i must be going murry is much of a small boy still i think in spite of his tragic airs i suspect his boast will come true the athenaeum will be the best literary paper in existence in months what will you write virginia he asked am i too modest in thinking fiat there was a shade of the perfunctory in the question anyhow i didnt persecute him with any degree of pressure i offered to look in on thursdays sometimes get a book sometimes to suggest an article he agreed quite cordially we went over all his names tried to think of others but agreed that once our intimate friends were gone through the field was mown of its poppies the younger generation promises very little so far an editor naturally sweeps the young writers very carefully i doubt that i was so much of an incubus to richmond as i thought while we were demurring a little to the idea of james as dramatic critic the dramatic critic looked in saw us i recommended desmond for the star part katherine will do novels every weekpray to god she dont do mine i feel the acid in her once moresince she doesnt take the trouble to write a card to fix an engagement but i shall try to go up there tomorrow judge the situation with my own eyes today we finished printing eliots poemsour best work so far by a long way owing to the quality of the ink macdermott has done murrys poem with such blots blurs that we must at any rate reprint the title page saturday march today among other things the coal strike is postponed the guards march through london l might have seen them but thought it not worth the loss ofhis seat in the tube as to private news our new bookcase came one part has been set up in the drawing room the other is too large to get upstairs to my room further we have decided to take cottages at tregerthen if we can get them this brings me to katherine murry from whom i heard of them the inscrutable woman remains inscrutable im glad to say no apologies or sense of apologies due at once she flung down her pen plunged as if wed been parted for io minutes into the question of dorothy richardson k so on with the greatest freedom animation on both sides until i had to catch my train perhaps its i who live in the suburbs think it necessary to answer letters that would be a proper retort to my jest of the underworld but somethingsomething dark catastrophic possibly to do with murry has taken place since we met so much she hinted but said she wished now to forget itsomething that had absorbed her apparently but this was a momentary revelation as i left otherwise as i say we chattered about the athenaeum mostly i was much complimented to hear how much they wish for my writing in proof of which i have a book this morning from murry and again as usual i find with katherine what i dont find with the other clever women a sense of ease interest which is i suppose due to her caring so genuinely if so differently from the way i care about our precious art though katherine is now in the very heart of the professional world books on her table to reviewshe is will always be i fancy not the least of a hack i dont feel as i feel with molly hamilton that is say ashamed of the inkpot before this i met hope mirrlees at the cluba very self conscious wilful prickly perverse young woman rather conspicuously well dressed pretty with a view of her own about books style an aristocratic conservative tendency in opinion a corresponding taste for the beautiful elaborate in literature for example she had been examining swift as to his use of words whether he used them properly found him deficient compared with burke who writes from this point of view magnificently though detestably from any other she uses a great number of french words which she pronounces exquisitely she seems capricious in her friendships no more to be marshalled with the long goose wand which i can sometimes apply to people than a flock of bright green parrokeets will you write to me hope i asked o no i cant write to people so we parted in the charing cross road for the next six months i suppose but to tell the truth what im thinking about most is neither katherine nor hope but the two cottages at higher tregerthen about now i suppose captain short of st ives is opening my letter six months after the voyage out vw had recently reviewed the fourth the tunnel in the tls of february kp c she wrote the reader is not provided with a story he is invited to embed himself in miriam hendersons consciousness dorothy richardson was a pioneer of the socalled streamofconsciousness method vw had last seen katherine mansfield on december in january the latter had begun a course of injections in the hope of curing her tuberculosis the nature of her illness and the severity of this treatment rather than her relationship with murry might account for the impression made on vw thursday march captain tregerthen short has now got my letter written me an answer even drawn me a sketch appears not only willing but anxious to let us have his three cottages at a rent of a year each i have replied also in the course of these last few days that we will probably take them truth to tell i have spent the greater part of the time on the slope beneath our house which leonard has already planted with fuchsias or crouched on a rock watching the great foam swirl of the waves in a pessimistic walk by the river yesterday l made this capacity for being happy first at asheham then at tregerthen the text of a discourse upon the illusory nature of all pleasures k pains from which he concludes that mankind is a wretched tribe of animals even the works of shakespeare no good save as his skill in doing it excites ones pleasure shall i own that i attribute some of this to my wretched family who asked me up to dine with them i went also to night day which l has spent the past mornings evenings in reading i own that his verdict finally pronounced this morning gives me immense pleasure how far one should discount it i dont know in my own opinion n d is a much more mature finished satisfactory book than the voyage out as it has reason to be i suppose i lay myself open to the charge of niggling with emotions that dont really matter i certainly dont anticipate even two editions and yet i cant help thinking that english fiction being what it is i compare for originality sincerity rather well with most of the moderns l finds the philosophy very melancholy it too much agrees with what he was saying yesterday yet if one is to deal with people on a large scale say what one thinks how can one avoid melancholy i dont admit to being hopeless thoughonly the spectacle is a profoundly strange one as the current answers dont do one has to grope for a new one the process of discarding the old when one is by no means certain what to put in their place is a sad one still if you think of it what answers do arnold bennett or thackeray for instance suggest happy onessatisfactory solutionsanswers one would accept if one had the least respect for ones soul now i have done my last odious piece of typewriting when i have scribbled this page i shall write suggest monday as the day for coming up to lunch with gerald i dont suppose ive ever enjoyed any writing so much as i did the last half of n d indeed no part of it taxed me as the voyage out did if ones own ease interest promise anything good i should have hopes that some people at least will find it a pleasure i wonder if i shall ever be able to read it again is the time coming when i can endure to read my own writing in print without blushing shivering wishing to take cover our dinner last night at the isola bella was rather a brilliant affair in the bohemian style with a great deal of wine talk of books pictures a general air of freedom contentthough i fancy that rogeri was specially warned by nessa not to let him know that she duncan were in the bath which casts some light on his point of view at the end of dinner the padrone as we called him clive chattered italian with the greatest gusto brought a large sketch book in which nessa duncan roger all drew pictures we were rewarded by a bottle of marsala then home leaving nessa roger in fitzroy street with clive mary k duncan following behind we talked by the way a great amount of athenaeum gossip all secretly delighted with our own importance clive roger to do art criticism the most brilliant list of contributors on record indeed i open this book again solely to record the fact that murry has applied to me for a signed article which i shall send him sunday march i open this book today merely to note that miss eleanor ormerod destroyer of insects promises well for murry should he take kindly to my first eccentrics i myself rather liked it that note being made l not in yet from staines i may add that im writing by the clear shrewd light of the sun though its five minutes to the half past five last night we changed our watches so the winter gloom is over for which i am half sorry since the dark evening over the fire has its charm moreover should i look out of the window i should see snow in the garden yesterday morning the glare of white on trees roofs when i drew the curtains was dazzling surmounted too by a bright blue sky as tender as june but falsely tender since outside one was scourged by the bitterest east wind ive not felt so cold this winter cold dashed in ones face k whirled up ones legs is far more cruel k harassing than a still profound frost the almond blossom is all gone as if it were cinderella when the clock struck i went up to tea at gordon sqre on friday having first visited spicer the paper makers in upper thames street clive sat at tea a little grumpy growing bald k now showing a forehead rather in the style of hall caine very queer as nessa said we all felt united again in that drawing room as though it were again k yet with so complete a rearrangement of our parts perhaps we are all much happier at any rate more secure k therefore tolerant towards each other then on to the club k dinner with the shoves k marjorie for whom of course we paid since they had all come out with no money geralds buttons burst off too k his coat came unsewn k on again across half mayfair discreet k semilit to the club meetingwhere my attention was drawn to a large picture the rape of the sabines i daresay given by edward owensmith in memory of his devoted wife elizabeth a christian mother who went home feb i find it impossible to keep out thoughts about all sorts of things k found that marjorie listened attentively but i can give no record of what happened save that l was elected again th wednesday april yesterday i took night k day up to geraldkhad a little half domestic half professional interview with him in his office i dont like the club mans view of literature for one thing it breeds in me a violent desire to boast i boasted of nessa k clive k leonard k how much money they made then we undid the parcel k he liked the title but found that miss maud annesley has a book called nights k dayswhich may make difficulties with mudies but he was certain he would wish to publish it k we were altogether cordial k i noticed how his hair is every blade of it white with some space between the blades a very sparsely sown field i had tea at gordon sqre shepherd sheppard norton nessa duncan k later clive the disturbing effect ofthe company is not so great as it was yet i feel that the presence of these very brightly lit brains makes things go swiftly k without padding and then they have different cups k saucers pictures on the walls k new chair covers later i withdrew with nessa though to withdraw is very difficult owing to the regulations about coal much domestic talk lil offering herself as it proves fruitlessly then dinner at the isola bella talk with clive k duncan clive insisting that eliot dislikes me k further trying to convince us that nessa roger himself lytton k i are the most hated people in london superficial haughty k giving ourselves airsthat i think is the verdict against the ladies i admit i hate not to be liked one ofthe drawbacks of bloomsbury is that it increases my susceptibility to these shades which are always made very visible by clive in so much that i own to have sulked a little under the suspicion that murry has confided to clive that he dislikes my article home to find l in bed a sight to restore confidence he had dined with bob trevy spoken at south place performed other activities which i give no account of mean he had been to the office the league of nations the labour party so that between us our range was wide yesterday forster is back again said by good dutch bessy to be more serious thursday april a great skip how accounted for i scarcely know writing hard at a times article on novels perhaps used up my desire for activity of the fingers then these last few days ive been submerged in defoe only steal io minutes from roxana to write this have to read one book a day in order to start on saturdaysuch is the life of a hack i went up to tea with janet noticed the signs of age in her gentle old ladyish smiles turns of speech for her age will be a profitable season and the eliots walter marjorie dined here on sunday i amused myself by seeing how sharp narrow much of a stick eliot has come to be since he took to disliking me his wife a washed out elderly worn looking little woman who was relieved to find walter lamb with his stories about the king provided for her indeed walter seemed to both the ideal of manhood gumbo held forth in her most vivacious commanding style i tried to secure faulker a nurse for nessa failed went up to the times on monday had an interview with richmonda restless vivacious little man jumping onto a chair to see the traffic over the blind chivvying a piece of paper round the room with his feet he offered many suggestions about houses in cornwall yesterday desmond appeared told us the strange story of elizabeth asquith hugh gibson which i have not time to write down but it is remarkable that years ago she knew nothing of the physical side of the sexes saturday april these ten minutes are stolen from moll flanders which i failed to finish yesterday in accordance with my time sheet yielding to a desire to stop reading go up to london but i saw london in particular the view of white city churches palaces from hungerford bridge through the eyes of defoe saw the old women selling matches through his eyes the draggled girl skirting round the pavement of st james square seemed to me out of roxana or moll flanders yes a great writer surely to be thus imposing himself upon me after years a great writer forster has never read his books i was beckoned by forster from the library as i approached we shook hands very cordially yet i always feel him shrinking sensitively from me as a woman a clever woman an up to date woman feeling this i commanded him to read defoe left him went got some more defoe having bought one volume at bickers on the way then to the club met alix all in a new outfit to match the spring brown too happier than usual being now mistress of gordon square where james is to lodge though she declares several dusky brazilians have made their head quarters there so home with l walking over hungerford bridge on a fine warm evening thinking of defoe as i say l is now off to address the cingalese herbert fisher has astounded us by asking himself to lunch tomorrow we have been to kew seen the magnolia trees in blossom thursday april we saw the magnolia tree in blossom next day with the minister for education himself he is a strange mixture of ascetic worldling the lean secluded man now finds himself dazzled by office with all his learning culture swept away by men of vitality affairs such a tribute as he paid to winston churchill might have been paid by some dazzled moth to a lamp he seems to see nothing clearly or else some notion of responsibility forbids him to say what he thinks he hums haws when asked a plain question murmurs on in a husky sort of whisper which seems bodiless blurred as himself his whole aspect is that of a worn half obliterated scholar made spruce by tailors doing his best to adopt the quiet distinguished manner of those who govern this is his official side in private he is a kindly even affectionate gentleman simple by nature though tarnished either by oxford or by his fisher blood with a supercilious superficial manner which leads him to dally urbanely in a way which belittles them with art letters everything but politics this used to irritatenow it merely amuses me he has long passed the shadow line his sarcasms seem directed at phantoms all clever official men even poor old goldie seem smoothed out of likeness to humanity impelled to babble on glibly entertainingly as if they were under a perpetual contract to keep the high table amused i do half the credit to say that he does not give himself airs save those of a person rendered responsible through no particular merit of his own we took him to kew chatted of oxford walter pater how chesterton is a genius george moore another by way of relief from politics and he approved of nature too likened the thames beneath a shower to a picture in the louvre he stood still on the bank for some minutes taking in the impression not as a person who is accustomed to looking at things looks but rather as a man who collects objects for the good ofhis soul so it was too with the buds of the magnolia at kew we had oliver inez to dinner as one of the couples they must be linked together thus what binds him to her i did not find it easy to see animation perhaps a kind of brisk professional manner it appears that she had read modern poetry can deliver her opinions as if they were her own im a little doubtful when i find a cheap ready made young woman out of an office in oxford street lodging at harrow enthusiastic about robinson crusoe nor do i attribute it wholly to my intellectual snobbery her face unlike the faces of all the other cropheads seemed to me vulgar unpleasant one must remember though that oliver is now verging upon a little grey at the temples abrupt inclined to be snappish so that his choice is not so wide as it was however one may abuse the stracheys their minds remain a source of joy to the end so sparkling definite k nimble need i add that i reserve the qualities i most admire for people who are not stracheys it is so long since i have seen lytton that i take my impression of him too much from his writing his paper upon lady hester stanhope was not one ofhis best could fill this page with gossip about peoples articles in the athenaeum since i had tea with katherine yesterday murry sat there mudcoloured mute livening only when we talked his shop he has the jealous partiality ofa parent for his offspring already i tried to be honest as if honesty were part of my philosophy said how i disliked grantorto on whistling birds lytton so on the male atmosphere is disconcerting to me do they distrust one despise one if so why do they sit on the whole length of ones visit the truth is that when murry says the orthodox masculine thing about eliot for example belittling my solicitude to know what he said of me i dont knuckle under i think what an abrupt precipice cleaves asunder the male intelligence how they pride themselves upon a point of view which much resembles stupidity i find it much easier to talk to katherine she gives resists as i expect her to we cover more ground in much less time but i respect murry i wish for his good opinion heinemann has rejected kms stories she was oddly hurt that roger had not invited her to his party her hard composure is much on the surface sunday easter zo april we are for the first time for many years spending easter in london we had arranged to go but dissolved all our arrangements in minutes partly to escape what was said to be the worst journey on record partly that l may get io clear days which will be possible at the end ofthe week i own to some hopes ofa wet easter but was disappointed both friday saturday were ofthe texture of full summer we walked along the river through the park on good friday the sun made the crowd to swelter unpleasantly they tramped placidly along in their coats skirts bowler hats leading their dogs save for a random terrier who had secured a muzzle meanwhile the green of the leaves thrust at least one inch out of the envelopes today the tree against the window has some perfectly shaped small leaves the tree at the end of the garden is as green as it will be until september on saturday bruce richmond came in person to fetch my defoe article we had a little talk about mistakes in proofs he prides himself upon letting none through his fingers charges such as do get through i was under the impression they were by no means rare to dalton and then we walked i came out in my summer things shady hat thin muslin dress stockings cloak on my arm today im sitting in a jersey serge over the fire but the evening repents through an open window the birds sing the leaves are yellow green in the sun l at staines in the idleness which succeeds any long article defoe is the nd leader this month i got out this diary read as one always does read ones own writing with a kind of guilty intensity i confess that the rough random style of it often so ungrammatical crying for a word altered afflicted me somewhat i am trying to tell whichever self it is that reads this hereafter that i can write very much better take no time over this forbid her to let the eye of man behold it and now i may add my little compliment to the effect that it has a slapdash vigour sometimes hits an unexpected bulls eye but what is more to the point is my belief that the habit of writing thus for my own eye only is good practise it loosens the ligaments never mind the misses the stumbles going at such a pace as i do i must make the most direct instant shots at my object thus have to lay hands on words choose them shoot them with no more pause than is needed to put my pen in the ink i believe that during the past year i can trace some increase of ease in my professional writing which i attribute to my casual half hours after tea moreover there looms ahead of me the shadow of some kind of form which a diary might attain to i might in the course of time learn what it is that one can make of this loose drifting material of life finding another use for it than the use i put it to so much more consciously scrupulously in fiction what sort of diary should i like mine to be something loose knit yet not slovenly so elastic that it will embrace any thing solemn slight or beautiful that comes into my mind i should like it to resemble some deep old desk or capacious holdall in which one flings a mass of odds ends without looking them through i should like to come back after a year or two find that the collection had sorted itself refined itself coalesced as such deposits so mysteriously do into a mould transparent enough to reflect the light of our life yet steady tranquil composed with the aloofness of a work of art the main requisite i think on rereading my old volumes is not to play the part of censor but to write as the mood comes or of anything whatever since i was curious to find how i went for things put in haphazard found the significance to lie where i never saw it at the time but looseness quickly becomes slovenly a little effort is needed to face a character or an incident which needs to be recorded nor can one let the pen write without guidance for fear of becoming slack untidy like vernon lee her ligaments are too loose for my taste but to return to life albeit with something of an effort i have forgotten to record desmonds visit his main purpose in coming was to get himself a bed but i can pardon these self seeking impulses on the part of desmond very easily my tolerance in this respect is far greater than poor mary sheepshanks who remarked bitterly that since she has gone to live at golders green her friends pay her visits on sundays for the sake of the country air but then i am happy mary s is not every virtue should be natural to the happy since they are the millionaires of the race i can give little account of desmond seeing that i was under contract to write all the morning he arrived late the night before as l had been kept by trains failing from reaching home till he was out of tune for friendship desmond is a very sensitive man he apologised did his best to charm did so in both our casesi thinkbut sure enoughls morning wasted in the sun of his laziness for though he took a chair into the window supplied himself with books the books started ideas the ideas had to be communicated lying in my bath next door i heard fragments of lord roberts speech read from the times then a disquisition upon the authenticity of barbellions diary this had gone on with one excursion to buy an abc railway guide since breakfast may we therefore be pardoned for inventing a cooks sister who was spending the holidays with us without this dear old desmond would be smoking his cigarettes talking about catching a train in the arm chair opposite at this moment as it was he had reluctantly to take himself off at lunch time fling himself upon a world of crowded trains accurate hours directing his steps towards oare where they have taken a house which molly is engaged upon getting into at this moment desmond declared that he had despatched a kitchen table to her but i own that i doubt it and who can say whether he has yet reached oare thursday april on easter monday we went up to visit the murrys see hampstead heath our verdict was that the crowd at close quarters is detestable it smells it sticks it has neither vitality nor colour it is a tepid mass of flesh scarcely organised into human life how slow they walk how passively brutishly they lie on the grass how little of pleasure or pain is in them but they looked well dressed well fed at a distance among the canary coloured swings roundabouts they had the look of a picture it was a summers dayin the sun at least we could sit on a mound look at the little distant trickle of human beings eddying round the chief centres of gaiety filing over the heath spotted upon its humps very little noise they made the large aeroplane that came flying so steadily over head made more noise than the whole crowd of us why do i say us i never for a moment felt myself one of them yet the sight had its charm i liked the bladders the little penny sticks the sight of two slow elaborate dancers performing to a barrel organ in a space the size of a hearthrug katherine murry murrys brother met us at their door we thought she would have enjoyed herself from the likeness of her prose to the scene on the contrary she was disgusted we had rather a stiff tea murrys brother is a bumpkin the rhodesian woman under a cloud of lacerated feelings i suppose katherine haggard powdered so on but it was no ones fault their talk of tregerthen combined with the image of it on a hot day made us determine to take it here now we have written to this effect to captain short i try not to hope since i feel sure we shall be disappointed let it three days ago or no answer at all that is what i imagine last night the coles dined here gave me my first view of them sharp positive hard minds in tense taut bodies in coles case the mouth seems fixed in a kind of snarl at the world a positive domineering young man he seemed she with less force equally sure of herself a good laugh would do them both good yet how laugh with those tight stretched drums for cheeks those curled sneering lips i dont accuse either of them of a desire to be savage or destructive i write from the outsiders unsympathetic point of view but leonard though he works at their works is still humane deliberate its the perpetual strife that strings them up in this way i think no speculative or contemplative or imaginative power seems to be left them and whats it all for who gains even if they do win their victories but i fancy that mrs cole is not a very clever woman such wits as she has use up all their force in keeping nimble she has nothing left over to play with this i write from the recollection of them which came to me on waking i dont like the coles i said to myself before i had time to set my faculties to work upon this judgment tomorrow we go down to asheham for io days alone leaving the servants to clean here intending to find a house for if we can for that is our solution at present the weather has gone to pieces the image is a true one it is much as if some serenely sailing ship had been wrecked on a splinter of rock left only tatters spars to be tossed in a swelter of grey sea monday may the day mother died twenty something years ago the smell of wreaths in the hall is always in the first flowers still without remembering the day i was thinking of her as i often doas good a memorial as one could wish now it is a fine evening the first since i wrote here last im just back from asheham leonard still to come in a fine but cloudy day an immense weight of sun piled up behind the clouds i race through so as to have time for a bath ah but how happy weve been at asheham it was a most melodious time everything went so freelybut i cant analyse all the sources of my joy heres leonard in to find a stack of books from the new statesman the drawing room floor littered with blueblack papers from roger lottie nelly chattering away about their house cleaning wednesday may thus my writing got interrupted but i had the hot bath i remember after duly though a little insincerely admiring what had been done in my absence to recapitulate the events of asheham is no longer in my power or perhaps since they were mainly of a spiritual nature requiring some subtlety to relate im too lazy to try happinesswhat i wonder constitutes happiness i daresay the most important element is work that rarely fails either of us now leonard of course had his telegram from sharp an article to do in a hurry but words now merely fill a morning pleasantly for him then there were two moments of some anxiety first a letter from captain short to say we can have tregerthen which we now possess then a letter from gerald to say he has read night day with the greatest interest will be delighted to publish it i suppose as i go to the trouble of copying his words verbatim that i was a good deal pleased by them the first impression of an outsider especially one who proposes to back his opinion with money means something though i cant think of stout smooth gerald smoking a cigar over my pages without a smile however a good deal beyond this letter in importance was captain shorts for a day to two i did nothing but put my pen down or my book see tregerthen considering the extreme inhospitality of eastbourne agents i daresay we are well advised from a practical point of view to be sure of some retreat but asheham as if to keep our loyalty breathed its usual charm it compares very well with charleston indeed ive never come back to it without that feeling of being incredulous as one perfection was added to another this time we spent most of our day in the house owing to the weather l scarcely left the garden one walk insufficiently clothed to southease was very bitter i got over to charleston though had a night morning alone with v so far as she can ever be alone there was pitcher the new gardener angelica julian quentin of course the new nurse a fire which wouldnt burn indeed living is fairly bare at the moment i had the rare sensation of its being necessary to eat in order to support life they have bread by the yard as if slid along a slot all the necessaries but not an ornament my life by comparison seems padded at every turn but they all looked as vigorous as possible the floors strewn with burnet stuffs for the flat as usual a good deal of domestic talk sleep in the ground floor room at night where this time last year about i heard the nightingales the fishes splashing in the pond white roses tapped at the window that night when i was told that angelica was in evidence nothing but wind rain this time no coal in the house yesterday tuesday we both renewed london life in the usual way save that i had to buy stuff for dresses as well as paper labels glue tea at the club where alix dusky dreary borrowed in order to give james his dinner they were going to hear bertie lecture i preferred the songsters of trafalgar square the steps of the column were built up pyramid fashion with elderly respectable householders grasping sheets of music which they rendered in time to a conductor on a chair beneath with great precision it was life boat day the elderly people were singing sailors chanties tom bowling this seemed to me a very amusing instructive spectacle being famished for music i could not get past but stood felt thrilled with an absurd visionary excitement walked over hungerford bridge making up stories monday may we are in the thick of our publishing season murry eliot myself are in the hands of the public this morning for this reason perhaps i feel slightly but decidedly depressed i read a bound copy of kew gardens through having put off the evil task until it was complete the result is vague it seems to me slight short i dont see how the reading of it impressed leonard so much according to him it is the best short piece i have done yet this judgment led me to read the mark on the wall i found a good deal of fault with that as sydney waterlow once said the worst of writing is that one depends so much upon praise i feel rather sure that i shall get none for this story i shall mind a little unpraised i find it hard to start writing in the morning but the dejection lasts only minutes once i start i forget all about it one should aim seriously at disregarding ups downs a compliment here silence there murry eliot ordered not me the central fact remains stable which is the fact of my own pleasure in the art and these mists of the spirit have other causes i expect though they are deeply hidden there is some ebb flow of the tide of life which accounts for it though what produces either ebb or flow im not sure but i have written nothing here for a week must cramp myself even now in order to cut some more covers tuesday was written down on friday may i had tea with km murry with whom i now adopt a manner of motherly badinage which is less fatiguing than the intellectual pose he has not yet shed all the husks of clever youth one feels him very unformed essentially capable of running on in an excited uneasy state about life such as i can recall in my own past one tacitly assumed it to be a mark of genius on sunday margaret lilian dined here margaret tending to be the flowing matron she increases in size one can fancy her fitting a large arm chair reluctant to move they seriously consider resignation lilian m whispered is getting unfit for so much work poor janet is depressed at having lost her job being fit for no other also very hard up indeed this is a melancholy season for them all but j has more than the usual shadows to depress her i laughed to myself over the quantities of armenians how can one mind whether they number or the feat is beyond me friday may these swarming hot summer days seem to quicken human life as well as vegetable one becomes a flower oozing honey upon which ones friends clusteror such is my version of the relationship this week weve had ottoline lytton ive been to see violet dickinson tonight the abrahamsons oliver strachey dine with us on saturday logan comes to tea on sunday we lunch with the webbs to say nothing of invitations weve refused leaving out a great squash at the club to hear forster speak on egypt when we met bob altounyan dora sanger with the usual varieties of old friends as usual my mind is too crammed to sift all these wares let me attempt ottoline since her hat veil on the sofa beside me recall her she was i think l was right in saying anxious to come out inspect us she struck her unmistakable note on entering the room rayed with green blue like the cornish sea magnificently upright held together her blue blood giving her the carriage of assurance selfrespect which is rare among the intellectuals we have taken this last week to dining in the garden there we sat on the flawless summer night with the apple trees softly snowed under with blossom a moon up certain layers of powder showed upon the steeps of her facebut when you reflect that shes close on has cropped her hair like a boy of course we talked personalities investigated the case of mary hutch eliot also gertler she was apparently as i believe genuinely kindly well wishing though considerably bewildered bewailing as usual her disasters in friendship inclined to blame everyone but herself though anxious for reconciliations plantive rather than bitter ls verdict was that she was very nice the first time he has ever said that the qualities which one has glimpses of in company were steadily visible in this domestic evening when there was nothing to stimulate no effort to rise to her intuitions are more penetrating than many of the profoundly reasonable remarks of our intellectuals to me she always has the pathos of a creature vaguely afloat in some wide open space without support or clear knowledge of its direction perhaps she was on her good behaviour but if so she was capable of wrapping herself in her great spanish cloak sallying out into the street without her hat shes altogether such a fancy dress character that a hat more or less seems immaterial we put her into her train with young officers who looked up startled despatched her to waterloo next day there was lytton i need not repeat the stock observations upon his mellow good humour it is more to the point to chronicle a renewed sense of affection which has never been seriously in abeyance the usual conviction that his wit what one calls personality are as peculiar to himself as his voice or his finger nails and then one thinks that it doesnt much matter if his writing is not profound or original one begins perhaps to suspect that it may be more original than one thinks he tells his stories of cunards winston lord ribblesdale admirably with marjories dramatic talent with a finer power of observation we scrutinised the condition of his soul with his help very closely ottoline had professed some alarm we came to the conclusion that it would be absurd not to have this butterflys season among the great the comparison between him the select norton alix james seemed entirely in his favour the touchstone of virtue with them now is whether you attend berties lectures or not i hereby vow to fuddle alix completely we sat on the river bank he told us of a visit to irene vanbrugh with his comedy how the singing of her canary birds almost drowned his voice how finally she determined against it finding a lack of human passion therefore the comedy is shelved for ever i suspect he writes will continue to write eminent victorians perhaps there was a little melancholy at this confession perhaps a little desire for commendation of lady hester stanhope which we withheld or perhaps i judge other writers craving for applause by my own ive had rogers praise of kew gardens by the way so i suppose im still safe though no longer greeted with such exciting raptures indeed the books sell very slowly it looks as though the market for such commodities is a small oneinfinitesimal we shant even pay our expenses it seems but with such a variety of matter to choose from this can scarcely be the fault of the books themselves it was novelty that sold them at first i broke from lytton with regret paid my visit to violet but she would have been hurt had i shirked it to judge at least by her pleasure at seeing me its odd how people of remain exactly she hasnt changed a hair for years which must be the length of our friendship we take things up precisely as we left them a years gap makes no difference we have had our intimacy something or other has fused never hardens again thus i felt in talking to her it was the usual inconsequent generous minded unselfish talk when i come onto the verge of the respectable classes im always struck by their unexpectedness v is as much of a democrat as i anr as little of an imperialist she blames england she has no hate of germany she sends clothes to russia yet she lives in manchester street consorts chiefly with people like the homers the thynnes has ozzie for a brother beatrice thynne has inherited a quarter of a niillion two large properties one of the finest libraries in england she has no idea what to make of them visits them in a distracted way to see which shed like to live in cant make up her mind to settle in either finally spends most of her time in grays inn looked after by a charwoman her only acknowledgement of her balance is that now then she pulls out strings of pearls parades the squares of the inn with such effect that lady h somerset has to beg her to remove them sunday may our seductive sweetness appears still to be drawing bees from all quarters last night i went to bed with lips so parched with talking brain so dazed that i could only tumble into sleep head foremost as we left lunch were on the stairs there was a great rapping at the door the hall immediately filled with strangers who eventually became roger pamela a strange silent foreign woman whom from her grey hair i took to be marjorie fry we pitched on the grass under a shower of apple blossom there sat until tea then logan came we only fell silent at half past six or even later nor was there a moment of repose neither for tongue nor brain it is true that logan does his turns which take the form of delightful adventureslife is like the arabian nights good stories quotations recitations but even these required intelligent attention he is a very well brushed bright eyed rosy cheeked man seemingly entirely satisfied with life which he appears to have mastered visiting each of its flowers like a bee these flowers he keeps stored in his waistcoat pocket lines from jeremy taylor carlyle lamb c an epicurean i suppose a little frosty i conjecture though kindly humane of course rather than human i believe his motive was to get us to print some new works of his anyhow he welcomed the invitation to submit them he lavished offers of help suggestions for increasing our sales altogether took the hogarth press in hand promises us a most splendid future he proposes to become our agent one must beware of becoming satellites of his set however cherishing single lines reprinting the essays of elia thursday may a few vegetable notes ought to prelude this page the weather continues fine the blue seems eternal an occasional wind rises we rock slightly then steady ourselves ride on serenely the apple blossom which deluged ottoline looked so soft beside her cheeks is over red rambler roses are pricking through we dine of course out of doors to the sound ofthe fountain the robins douche themselves there last night there were six voices to drown its perpetual drippingaltounyan a k bob dining with us had a vision of bob as a tory squire at any rate a conservative mahogany coloured gentleman innocent of rhyme how far this is from the truth may be gauged from the fact that he swells with four separate volumes is to be delivered in the autumn the good shrewd sound trevelyan stock shows through moreover he is well cropped brown for a poet he is also a comic character rises higher in that sphere when he feels himself inspired by laughter his ungainly compliments to karin his eager awkward ways made us all shout with laughter altounyan is an effervescent armenian shy but ready to bubble on provocation either ofa literary or political nature but bob talked us all down i must omit an exquisitely nattering duet between me a when i had a surfeit of praise for kew gardensthe best prose of the th century surpassing mark on the wall possessing transcendent virtues save for one passage between the women highly admired by clive roger i was at pains to sweeten his enthusiasm with this relish since his native product is not of the very highest quality perhaps yes authors are rather a despicable race i think id composed myself to face failure so stoically that this unexpected gift was at the moment delicious forster approves too but altounyan has weighted his praises with a thick wad of mss written not typed which we are to read consider upon our verdict depends the whole of his future further he appointed us his literary executors everything he writes in armenia is to be sent to usto do what we like with he gave us towards our future still to read a novel in manuscript settle a young mans future his wifes his childrensthat is a severe price for io minutes of praise adrian seemed to me to deserve hendersons saying he knows the right sneer for every occasion he strikes me as more more ofa moon to the lusty red sun provided by karin the light he throws upon whatever turns up is more k more bleaching and cadaverous the truth is he has no occupation sunday may the day recalls the fact that we lunched with the webbs this time last week i have made no note of it there was the weak distinguished looking yet vaguely apologetic noel buxton arnott rather self assertive on the contrary owing everything to his wits without an ounce of distinction thrown in cannot get over my distaste for the fabian type though if it came to spending a year on a desert island i suppose i should choose him rather than buxton i dont know the webbs were very quotable mrs webbs brilliant idea of municipal bricks for children inscribed with the names of organisations so that in putting them together they would learn their civic duties was almost too much in character to be suitable even sidney had his mild joke at her noel buxton obsequiously offered his son for the experiment rich men nowadays can be seen divesting themselves of particles of gold with a view to the eye of the needle then later in the week mrs woolf sylvia came to tea bringing fresh eggs lilies of the valley sylvia amused me by her assurance that the affairs of putney are of moment to the world her anxiety to get stories of her own house hunting adventures correctedas though these were matters of importance and mrs woolf as usual pleased me by her childishness by which i mean her freshness inconsequence as if all her life were still spent among the little incidents goings on of a large nursery she couldnt face a play she told me but she could just manage lunch at the carlton why the boundary line between the impossible comes there i dont know and bella since berties death finds life necessary to keep up her spirits is learning to jazz her eyes prevent her from reading much but she writes her page in little folks her friends are all very good to her she has gone to bexhill with martin emma it is predicted that martin will be made not quite a knight but the next best thing martin believes in orders i gather our laughter at the obe must have saddened him the other night philip is cutting off lambs tails they are made into a pie at night philip who would step aside to avoid a caterpillar once fought harold for using worms for bait was chased by harold to the next village in the isle of wight where they were staying i ran after them miles miles thinking that the end ofthe world had come naturally mrs woolf had no time to read sophoclesnor have i for the matter of that lytton came to tea on friday half maliciously assured me that my industry amazed him my industry my competence for he thinks me the best reviewer alive k the inventor of a new prose style k the creator of a new version of the sentence peoples compliments generally manage to reserve the particular praise they wish to have themselves but we are surprisingly honest we have a clear perception of the others meaning he asserted that he was disgusted by his own stereotyped ways his two semi colons his method of understatement k his extreme definiteness without agreeing i conveyed my sense of his dangers k urged him to write playsstoriesanything to break the mould of the early victorians after a volume on victoria in the same manner he is going to attempt it but then moneyhe must make moneyhe cant write reviewsk ive to do addison k other books k protested that all the same im not a hack k he runs the risk of becoming a logan a superior dilettante to which he agreed then we talked about addison read scraps of johnsons lives so enjoyed ourselves he told me about princess sophia the d of cumberland to the squires party monday june whitmonday i know i meant to convey my sense of the degradation of the squires party but the sense has faded is not worth recapturing a week at asheham has intervenedfrom one tuesday to another an odd thing happened to me at asheham where i count upon becoming clearer more concentrated reading print as if through a magnifying glass the very opposite of this took place i dozed drowsed seemed to feel the sun in my brain sending all my thoughts to seek repose in the shadow i write there at an open window looking onto the field the field was gilt with buttercups the sheep were tempting in their indolence in short i used to find the morning gone only a few lines written so it was with my addison or whoever it might be after tea our ship rode so steady that one came to disbelieve in motion or the possibility of change we appeared wedged in the blue perhaps one day there was a cloud but no harbourage was offered it congregation of clouds was impossible the loveliness of asheham once again brimmed the cup overflowed wild ideas seized us of building a house at the lay to give up every foothold in that region seemed unthinkable l bicycled round brought news of an ancient manor house at denton which excited hopes but the sight of it next day completely dashed them in order to popularise this large stuffy ill lit slightly mouldy decayed mansion the owner a london publican dazzled into purchasing by the aristocratic name but unable to induce his wife to live there hit on the ambitious plan of starting a line i omnibuses to run from london deliver their loads at the manor rouse where tea would be provided one such feast was held as long oards stretched on trestles a few dozen green wineglasses testified but the device failed the londoners had seen more seductive sights than denton manor it is still in the market with the notion of building a house se running strong in my mind i went to charleston for a night k was s disabused of such fantasies very completely to recapitulate a story ws article on addison was published in the tls on june kp c the lives of the poets biographical and critical studies by samuel nson princess sophia fifth daughter of george iii was believed to have had legitimate son by her brother the duke of cumberland general thomas garth consented to pass for the father of this child although the story was apparently told verbally several times would be dull but nessa i quarrelled as nearly as we ever do quarrel now over the get up of kew gardens both type woodcuts she firmly refused to illustrate any more stories of mine under those conditions went so far as to doubt the value of the hogarth press altogether an ordinary printer would do better in her opinion this both stung chilled me not that she was bitter or extreme its her reason control that give her blame its severity anyhow i left in rather a crumpled condition paused in lewes on ls advice to see a house on the hill a degree of that refinement smug efficiency which one finds in surrey houses set me against the white house i trudged down into lewes again in no cheerful mood with three hours moreover to spend there to pass the time more than anything i asked mrs wycherley about houses she after tepidly recommending some that were impossible sketching the difficulties of the situation bethought her of one newly on the market small old actually in lewes perhaps a little humble for one used to lodge at asheham i pricked my ears since this is always the way one is told of what one wants off i went up pipes passage under the clock saw rising at the top of the sloping path a singular shaped roof rising into a point spreading out in a circular petticoat all round it then things began to go a little quicker an elderly and humble cottage woman the owner showed me over how far my satisfaction with the small rooms the view the ancient walls the wide sitting room the general oddity character of the whole place were the result of finding something that would do that one could conceive living in that was cheap freehold i dont know but as i inspected the rooms i became conscious of a rising desire to settle here to have done with looking about to take this place make it ones permanent lodging perhaps later it will amuse me to read how i went from one grade to another of desire till i felt physically hot ardent ready to surmount all obstacles i liked the way the town dropped from the garden leaving us on a triangular island vegetables one side grass the other the path encircling the round house amused me nor are we overlooked in short i took it there then being egged on by wycherleys hesitation hints of a purchaser who had already asked for the refusal lewes that afternoon with its many trees laburnums water meadows sunny bow windowed houses broad high street looked very tempting dignified the end of the story which i must curtail is that we have bought the round house are now secure ofa lodging on earth so long as we need sleep or sit anywhere tuesday june i must use up the fifteen minutes before dinner in going on again in order to make up the great gap we are just in from the club from ordering a reprint of the mark on the wall at the pelican press from tea with james his news is that maynard in disgust at the peace terms has resigned kicked the dust of office off him is now an academic figure at cambridge but i must really sing my own praises since i left off at the point when we came back from asheham to find the hall table stacked littered with orders for kew gardens they strewed the sofa we opened them intermittently through dinner quarrelled im sorry to say because we were both excited opposite tides of excitement coursed in us they were blown to waves by the critical blast of charleston all these orders about from shops private peoplecome from a review in the lit sup presumably by logan in which as much praise was allowed me as i like to claim and days ago i was stoically facing complete failure the pleasure of success was considerably damaged first by our quarrel second by the necessity of getting some copies ready cutting covers printing tables glueing backs finally despatching which used up all spare time some not spare till this moment but how success showered during those days gratuitously too i had a letter from macmillan in new york so much impressed by the voyage out that they want to read night day i think the nerve of pleasure easily becomes numb i like little sips but the psychology of fame is worth considering at leisure i fancy ones friends take the bloom off lytton lunched here on saturday with the webbs when i told him my various triumphs did i imagine a little shadeinstantly dispelled but not before my rosy fruit was out of the sun well i treated his triumphs in much the same way i cant feel gratified when he expatiates upon a copy of eminent victorians lined initialled m or h by mr mrs asquith yet clearly the thought produced a comfortable glow in him the luncheon was a suc cess we ate in the garden lytton sported very gracefully yet with more than his old assurance over the conversation but im not interested in ireland saturday june the weather seems unbreakable a delphinium is out today in the garden one sweet william lottie was discovered brushing the grass with a hearth broom as though attending to the coat of some pet animal they say the strawberry crop will be ruined this is a serious matter for us as we have just bought lbs of sugar had arranged a great jam making strawberries are a lb at this moment asparagus d d k yesterday at rays i ate my first green peas i had a hampstead field day first the murrys then adrian karin finally dinnerit was by the time i got itwith ray dorothy bussy a very severe review of murry a severe review of eliot appeared in the lit sup on thursday considering their general slackness i dont see why they choose to come down so hard upon murry i wish they hadnt i attribute the extreme depression of him katherine at least partly to this and i felt gorged florid with my comparative success poor murry pretended not to mind but much like a small boy sticking it out that caning doesnt hurt a poem is a very sensitive part to be beaten but katherine looks so ill haggard that i suppose health may make a great part of her depression she is going to san remo for a year in september murry means to live alone in the country i dont see how all this being so they can look forward to their future and then theres the question of katherines writing isnt she a little querulous restless about that standing emphatically yet not quite firmly on her rights as an artist as people do who must insist upon being one in token of this she told me a long to me rather distasteful story about her dealings with a man called schiff who wanted her to contribute to art k letters k dared to offer her advice upon which she got on her high horse k wrote him such a letter that he replied humblyin a style that i couldnt make anything of k indeed the rights k wrongs of the whole business escaped me though i protested im ashamed to say that i share katherines indignation what a fraud one is in many ways but then if ones on this footing of being fellow artists all that ones relations are queered from the start anyhow i went off rather sombre leaving them to their spare lonely meal nothing seeming to grow or flourish round them leafless trees wednesday june i went off as i now remember to call on adrian as i was early for ray found that strange couple just decided to become medical students after years training they will being aged or so set up together in practise as psychoanalysts this is the surface bait that has drawn them the more profound cause is i suppose the old question which used to weigh so heavy on adrian what to do here is another chance visions of success a busy crowded interesting life beguile him halfway through i suppose something will make it all impossible then having forgotten his law he will take up whatfarming or editing a newspaper or keeping bees perhaps i dont see that it matters at all so long as they always have some carrot dangling in front of them dinner with ray talk with dorothy bussy of her past promise of her play so home with l who had dined higher up with margaret that morning friday th to be exact i got the first proofs of my novel ive now had pages on sunday we planned to go to kew have tea there but logan rang us up we came home to see him more stories a little less carefully told so more to my liking then we came indoors he read us his stories from the bible at this moment we have the following manuscripts or promises of manuscripts paris by hope mirrlees novel by altounyan stories by logan play by d bussy rays grandmothers sexualreligious experiences and old bob caught leonard last night at the apostles dinner pressed upon him a translation of lucretius what steps were to take is not at the moment clear to me whether to become a shop or remain a small private presswhether to get help or refuse it logan of with money and hospitality he published novels under the penname stephen hudson and was to translate prousts le temps retrouve he financed the quarterly art and letters course has a charming young man up his sleeve how futile these elderly people are theres maurice baring gone printed one copy of an anthology at a cost of to give lady diana manners for a present she is one of those vaguely literary people who sometimes read shakespeare logan approves of this on the whole he likes to supervise these literary undertakings would even give money but doesnt want to be disturbed out of his habits he is printing several anthologies himself in the autumn i consider that ive done my bit he said with a comfortable sigh after saying that he had been correcting the proofs of these works he now goes yatchting for a holiday yesterday tuesday i was treated to ices at gunters by clive it was all the same as before little tables long rather dark shop numbers of gilt chairs discreet buffet elderly waitresses in black couples scattered all about silently or almost silently absorbing ices sugared cakes there was an aristocratic small boy got up like a picture of queen victoria as a child with a great sash a bow a hat wreathed in roses his mother had brought him in we thought from one of the great berkeley square houses then there was youth by some misadventure not at ascot a coffeecoloured young man a semitransparent girl we strolled out of this solemn cave sauntered through the purest th century london to the green park where we sat on hard green chairs watched people passing down the little slope towards the palace this being i suppose the th week without rain the grass is already haycoloured slippery we gossiped speculated reminisced very easy agreeable talk to my mind then what an age ive known him how much weve been through side by sidethese infrequent meetings are little islands upon which one stands surveying the flood racing away in the past looking out over the future safely with very little anxiety just at present he talks of going to paris in the autumn to see whats on hes given up his book finds that articles of words exactly suit him he thinks of subjects in his bath he makes money he spends it on ices dinners at the cafe royal he dines out every night enjoys every moment feels his senses quicker stronger as time goes on we agreed in finding life very delightful though very different for each of us home to await miss barbara lynch but she never came the meeting talked to its hearts con tent mrs whitty another pressed me for copies of kew gardens but i dont want them to read the scene of the two women is that to the discredit of kew gardens perhaps a little ive just been there in the flesh sat under a tree reading the way of all flesh which i have to review tomorrow according to fredegond theres been a crisis between alix james she tried to break with him failed went reeling off to tidmarsh in what state of mind i dont quite know there is at the moment james inhabits gordon sqre monday june if i hadnt had since midday to settle myself i should still be twanging twittering with garsington but parties dont fluster me as they used i dont much care now about the great question of hair k doing up dresses i am resigned to my station among the badly dressed though grave a dressmaker her vagaries the speeding up of my blue dress doubts as to its beauty scarcely seem to confirm that statement here i think the great k at present sore question of aesthetic taste enters in why am i calm k indifferent as to what people say of night k day k fretful for their good opinion of my blue dress however this may be i enjoyed garsington saying to myself the worst moment will be when i come into the drawing room in my blue dress before dinner i planned thus to get dressed quick k come in before ott which is not difficult as ott never gets dressed quick mercifully i need not face garsington squarely k draw its picture i observed that the sealing wax red drawing room is a good deal smaller this visit than last k last visit than first thats what happens to people too there was young lord de la warr walking among the roses k cabbages a boy of who after sweeping mines as a seaman is now a socialist under the guidance of lansbury but i took a good look at him k noticed the straightness of his body ease k certainty of his manner which mark him out from gertler quite emphatically gertler k nelson strolled up another garden path nelson one of the insignificant i should say who has attached himself firmly to the comforts of garsington his anxiety to accept an invitation to dinner proved his relish for that one of ottolines bounties the population was floating k changing goldie k i were permanent aldous h came for one night i shall leave out several names if i try to count them young lord de la warr said very little but i think he would have impressed an american k good manners conciliate me i think goldie was the principle element in the week end that is to say that he took upon him the brunt of sunday morning k meal times hours sitting on a hard seat with ott k me philip sometimes gertler occasionally k aldous off k on was a trial but for us all it was well surmounted i did not guess the time once when philip suggested a visit to the pigs i was ready but not overready i think we discussed roger most carefully k forster k bob ott needled away at her embroidery philips bedspread losing her needle once k crouching on all fours behind the seat while goldie k i went on talking this seemed to me to typify her modest position so long as people talk she doesnt much want to interfere k she listens especially if peoples characters are discussed she had worked off the great picasso grievance upon goldie i had only vague lamentations k aspirations for my share yet it struck me as strange thursday july what struck me as strange i cant now remember or even guess perhaps i meant to finish by trying to define the sense of purposelessness which now k then beset me suppose we do settle exactly what rogers character is k what degree of spite to allow clive k how far logan has a heartwell what then are we going nowhere does the mist move with us wellthis is too far gone for recapturing though there was a queer enough sequel a day or two later at asheham we went there on the thursday following k came back yesterday i cant give much space to philips letter though seeing how many matters i must despatch how to purify my mind i must have a brush with the ajax before l comes in philips letter was all about my lack of heart k his terror of me to which eton he had been the moving spirit behind the foundation of the college political society at the first meeting of which in december george lansbury the idealistic socialist leader and pacifist had been one of the speakers geoffrey nelson c was a painter of bohemian tendencies for whom lytton strachey had harboured a fruitless passion some years before picasso was in london during the summer of in connection with his decor for the russian ballet clive bell and maynard keynes arranged a dinner party for him which occasioned his refusing lady ottolines invitation to garsington and she herself was not invited to the dinner see vw letters nos also vwgls letters p i have rejoined if im bloomsbury youre mayfair to his bewilderment as i hope but this is moonshine the solid fact is that we own besides the round house monks house at rodmell with three quarters of an acre of land we own monks house this is almost the first time ive written a name which i hope to write many thousands of times before ive done with it for ever it happened thus as we walked up the steep road from the station last thursday on our way to inspect the round house we both read out a placard stuck on the auctioneers wall lot monks house rodmell an old fashioned house standing in three quarters of an acre of land to be sold with possession the sale we noted was on tuesday to take place at the white hart that would have suited us exactly l said as we passed i loyal to the round house murmured something about the drawbacks of rodmell but suggested anyhow a visit to the place so we went on i think a slight shade of anticlimax had succeeded my rather excessive optimism at any rate the round house no longer seemed so radiant unattainable when we examined it as owners i thought l a little disappointed though just polite even to its merits the day lacked sun the bedrooms were very small the garden not a country garden anyhow it seemed well to plan a visit to rodmell on the following day i bicycled over against a strong cold wind this time i flatter myself that i kept my optimism in check these rooms are small i said to myself you must discount the value of that old chimney piece the niches for holy water monks are nothing out ofthe way the kitchen is distinctly bad theres an oil stove no grate nor is there hot water nor a bath as for the ec i was never shown it these prudent objections kept excitement at bay yet even they were forced to yield place to a profound pleasure at the size shape fertility wildness of the garden there seemed an infinity of fruitbearing trees the plums crowded so as to weigh the tip of the branch down unexpected flowers sprouted among cabbages there were well kept rows of peas artichokes potatoes raspberry bushes had pale little pyramids of fruit i could fancy a very pleasant walk in the orchard under the apple trees with the grey extinguisher of the church steeple pointing my boundary on the other hand there is little viewobut ive forgotten the lawn smoothly rolled rising in a bank sheltered from winds too a refuge in cold storm large earthen pot holds sway where the path strikes off crowned with a ft of purple samphire one pot not two there is little ceremony or precision at monks house it is an unpretending house long low a house of many doors on one side fronting the street of rodmell wood boarded on that side though the street of rodmell is at our end little more than a cart track running out on to the flat of the water meadows there are if memory serves me no less than three large outhouses of different kinds a stable k a hen house the machinery ofa granary one shed full of beams of ancient oak another stored with pea props but our fruit vegetables are said to flow over each summer into these receptacles to need selling though so obliging in its prolific way as to flourish under the care ofa single old man whose heart is of gold who for years i think has spent his spare time in tending these trees for the late mr jacob verrall all this made a happy kind of jumble in my brain together with the store of old fashioned chairs tables glass furniture with which every inch of room space is crowded i came back told my story as quietly as i could next day l i went together made a thorough inspection he was pleased beyond his expectation the truth is he has the making of a fanatical lover of that garden it suits me very well too to ramble off among the telscombe downs when fine or tread out my paces up the path across the lawn when dark or wind blown in short we decided walking home to buy if we could sell round house as we conjecture we can eight hundred we made our limit which according to wycherley gave us a good chance of possession the sale was on tuesday i dont suppose many spaces of five minutes in the course of my life have been so close packed with sensation was i somehow waiting to hear the result while i watched the process of an operation the room at the white hart was crowded i looked at every face in particular at every coat skirt for signs of opulence was cheered to discover none but then i thought getting l into line does he look as if he had in his pocket some of the substantial farmers might well have their rolls of notes stuffed inside their stockings bidding began someone offered not an offer said the auctioneer who was immediately opposed to us as a smiling courteous antagonist a beginning the next bid was then they rose by fifties wycherley standing by us silent unmoved added his advance six hundred was reached too quick for me little hesitations interposed themselves but went down rather dismally fast the auctioneer egged us on i daresay there were six voices speaking though after of them dropped out left only a mr tattersall competing with mr wycherley we were allowed to bid in twenties then tens then fives still short of so that our eventual victory seemed certain seven hundred reached there was a pause the auctioneer raised his hammer very slowly held it up a considerable time urged exhorted all the while it slowly sank towards the table now mr tattershall another bid from youno more bidding once ive struck the tableten pounds five poundsno more for the last time thendump down it came on the table to our thanksgiving i purple in the cheeks l trembling like a reedsold to mr wycherley we stayed no longer out we went into the high street very nearly quarrelled over the address of rogers house tuesday july we went on however l to asheham i to charleston where there was maynard a good deal of brisk talk he is disillusioned he says no more does he believe that is in the stability of the things he likes eton is doomed the governing classes perhaps cambridge too these conclusions were forced on him by the dismal degrading spectacle of the peace congress where men played shamelessly not for europe or even england but for their own return to parliament at the next election they were not wholly vicious they had spasms of well meaning but a fate seemed to possess the business from the first driving it all in the most fatal direction soon no one had the strength to resist he resigned is now a don at cambridge daily rejecting profitable offers made him by houses of business willing according to duncan to pay a year for his attendance for a short time daily we all came up to london early next day nessa having to see a mr cholmondeley about julians education we had an afternoons gaiety at the ballet then went back to gordon sqre everything a little glittering unreal as usual after the country in nessas presence friday the th i went to tea with katherine since i begin to feel my visits numbered how seriously i dont know but once she gets abroad whats to bring her back murry poor man pale sad as usual for she is again only just out of bed the weather of course is taking its revenge now for a season of generosity we have fires every night worse than the cold is the drab coloured sky so that ones whole existence seems to be in the shadow on saturday we saw the horse show i had a look at queen alexandras poor old effigy still painted like a wildrose though she is about can only hobble up a ladder like a decrepit washerwoman its only on the face that the pretence can be preserved on sunday mrs hamilton brought her sisterthe poetto dinner i almost laughed at the sight of her she stumps peering hesitating into a room shakes hands with emphasis displays a small round pale face with wisps of brown hair controlled by a tight band of ribbon a mixture of schoolgirl german professor to look at awkward restless in manner delivering herself of rounded periods which would be queer enough in themselves were they not delivered with the oddest rotundity of diction as of one speaking from a tub in a voice that swells falls but finally swells like a musical instrument imperfectly controlled in spite of these curiosities of manner appearance she seemed perfectly self possessed referred to her stock of book learning which seemed very large various with the greatest composure as nietchze says or to quote dostoevsky or in the opinion of the neocartesians such were her conversational openings waiting no season but obtruding themselves spontaneously i do not myself feel any doubt as to the nature of the good nor have i indeed ever felt any doubt upon that point this was fired off when the talk was not concerned with anything of the kind yet one couldnt dislike her or dub her a very poisonous variety of the prig i suppose her to be the family prodigy fed on books living up to now in a dark cave until like a creature deprived of light the complexion of her soul is entirely white she has the mind of an albino what is to become of her i dont suspect her a poet i imagine her one of those prodigies who quite contentedly continue all their lives in some country village to absorb learning have their circle of correspondents her letters must be portentous molly watched her with the oddest mixture of pride uneasiness what were we thinking of her did we realise that these manners views were only superficial did we not see how remarkable a product she wascould we not perhaps be made by artful questions hints to see it margot is now readingon comparative religions margot spent all her life pretending she was a monk or rob roy we now hesitate whether or not to ask to read her poems thursday july i have forgotten several people i see one is arundell del re logans prize young man devoted to the cause of good books proposing to start a shop in chelsea for the promotion of them he intends not only selling on a select principle but binding printing providing a room where book lovers can love books his weakness paleness did not impress us but then perhaps weakness and paleness are the necessary qualities at a pinch too i think like most men he has business qualities brains enough to be dependable his most serious contribution to an evening of vague discussion was that he should relieve us of all the business of the hogarth press stock our books keep our accounts in return for which were to give him a few lessons in printing i suppose something may come of it last night i dined at the savoy grill room with clive it is long since eating a meal was such a serious business to melong since i had taken part in the great ceremony of dinner with others believing in it assisting at it dressing for it fish meat melon ices have come to their own again clive parted with a good deal of paper money his appearance never even now is altogether smart or wordly his shoulders are not broad enough then his hair but he was dressed carried a black cane wore a silk hat oddly enough my mind went back to my first sight of him years ago he looked young had the unselfassured manner of one not used to things only pretending use this ceremony of eating takes so long that it was by the time we finished the light through the enormous window dusky almost lamplit he pointed out to me picasso mdme picasso making off for the ballet behind us sat the little ivory figure of lopokhovas husband thus there was every reason for clive to feel assured we drove back to gordon square talked about the problems of literature on his table lay his puff of me in the new republic i daresay i should have preferred not to be bracketed with eliot murry wonder if i talk nonsense about writing to clive on the whole i believe that he has an odd gift for making one talk sense hes so eager that one should talk sense his enthusiasm is the engaging thing about himdeducting the tribute of his enthusiasm for me moreover whatever one may think of his taste in life however one may feel him a little battered dusty in the pursuit of pleasure still theres his honesty his vivacity his determination not to be bored not to bore in his own way he is somehow a figure saturday july in public affairs i see ive forgotten to say that peace was signed perhaps that ceremony was accomplished while we were at asheham ive forgotten the account i was going to write out ofthe gradual disappearance of things from shop windows the gradual but still only partial reappearance of things sugar cakes currant buns mounds of sweets the effect of the war would be worth describing one of these days at monks housebut why do i let myself imagine spaces of leisure at monks house i know i shall have books that must be read there too just as here now i should be reading herman melville thomas hardy not to say sophocles if im to finish the ajax as i wager myself to do before august but this dressing up of the future is one of the chief sources of our happiness i believe theres still a good deal of the immediate past asserting its claim on me i met morgan forster on the platform at waterloo yesterday a man physically resembling a blue butterflyi mean by that to describe his transparency lightness he had been conveying the luggage of indians from deptford to waterloo indians seemed to weigh him down we exchanged compliments on our writingim surprised to find him openly liking a compliment though its nothing strange in myself discussed altounyans work a little he did not at all care for it no form no character no one figure dominating the others i like forster very much though i find him whimsical vagulous to an extent that frightens me with my own clumsiness definiteness then i bought my bag of coffee so up to katherine with whom i spent my hour very happily indeed i like her more more think we have reached some kind of durable foundation home to a dinner party consisting ofthe two altounyans ernest norah carrington the male herbert woolf after dinner poor scatterbrained a showed the least pleasant side of himself in discussing his novel which he does not merely with passion but with a conceit that would be irritating if it werent transparently foolish his only anxiety is to find how many people are capable of understanding him about the merits of his work he has no doubt cut short my laborious critical survey of them rather coolly he proposed that we should be his agents finding publishers for all his works for ever this is all rather foreign as i found it foreign though pleasantly foreign of him to tell me how many people had wished to marry his sisterfor she wishes very much to be married yes she said simply if one hasnt a profession one must marry one must look after someone i liked her better than i like him as for carrington he will be a very popular man in the east satuday july one ought to say something about peace day i suppose though whether its worth taking a new nib for that purpose i dont know im sitting wedged into the window so catch almost on my head the steady drip of rain which is pattering on the leaves in ten minutes or so the richmond procession begins i fear there will be few people to applaud the town councillors dressed up to look dignified march through the streets ive a sense of holland covers on the chairs of being left behind when everyones in the country im desolate dusty disillusioned of course we did not see the procession we have only marked the rim of refuse on the outskirts rain held off till some half hour ago the servants had a triumphant morning they stood on vauxhall bridge saw everything generals soldiers tanks nurses bands took hours in passing it was they said the most splendid sight of their lives together with the zeppelin raid it will play a great part in the history of the boxall family but i dont knowit seems to me a servants festival some thing got up to pacify placate the people now the rains spoiling it perhaps some extra treat will have to be devised for them thats the reason of my disillusionment i think theres something calculated politic insincere about these peace rejoicings moreover they are carried out with no beauty not much spontaneity flags are intermittent we have what the servants out of snobbishness i think insisted upon buying to surprise us yesterday in london the usual sticky stodgy conglomerations of people sleepy torpid as a cluster of drenched bees were crawling over trafalgar square rocking about the pavements in the neighbourhood the one pleasant sight i saw was due rather to the little breath of wind than to decorative skill some long tongue shaped streamers attached to the top ofthe nelson column licked the air furled unfurled like the gigantic tongues of dragons with a slow rather serpentine beauty otherwise theatres music halls were studded with stout glass pincushions which rather prematurely were all radiant withinbut surely light might have shone to better advantage however night was sultry magnificent so far as that went we were kept awake some time after getting into bed by the explosion of rockets which for a second made our room bright and now in the rain under a grey brown sky the bells of richmond are ringingbut church bells only recall weddings christian services i cant deny that i feel a little mean at writing so lugubriously since were all supposed to keep up the belief that were glad enjoying ourselves so on a birthday when for some reason things have gone wrong it was a point of honour in the nursery to pretend years later one could confess what a horrid fraud it seemed if years later these docile herds will own up that they too saw through it will have no more of itwellshould i be more cheerful i think the dinner at the club mrs besants speech rubbed the gilt if there were any grains remaining effectually off the gingerbread hobson was sardonic shea massive sulky featured old lady with a capacious head however thickly covered with curly white hairbegan by comparing london lit up festive with lahore and then she pitched into us for our maltreatment of india she apparently being them not us but i dont think she made her case very solid though superficially it was all believable the club applauded agreed i cant help listening to speaking as though it were writing thus the flowers which she brandished now again looked terribly artificial it seems to me more more clear that the only honest people are the artists that these social reformers philanthropists get so out of hand harbour so many discreditable desires under the disguise of loving their kind that in the end theres more to find fault with in them than in us but if i were one of them sunday july perhaps i will finish the account of the peace celebrations what herd animals we are after alleven the most disillusioned at any rate after sitting through the procession the peace bells unmoved i began after dinner to feel that if something was going on perhaps one had better be in it i routed up poor l threw away my walpole first lighting a row of glass lamps seeing that the rain was stopped we went out just before ten explosions had for some time promised fireworks the doors of the public house at the corner were open the room crowded couples walzing songs being shouted waveringly as if one must be drunk to sing a troop of little boys with lanterns were parading the green beating sticks not many shops went to the expense of electric light a woman of the upper classes was supported dead drunk between two men partially drunk we followed a moderate stream flowing up the hill illuminations were almost extinct halfway up but we kept on till we reached the terrace and then we did see somethingnot much indeed for the damp had deadened the chemicals red green yellow blue balls rose slowly into the air burst flowered into an oval of light which dropped in minute grains expired there were hazes of light at different points rising over the thames among trees these rockets were beautiful the light on the faces of the crowd was strange yet of course there was grey mist muffling everything taking the blaze off the fire it was a melancholy thing to see the incurable soldiers lying bed at the star garter with their backs to us smoking cigarettes waiting for the noise to be over we were children to be amused so at eleven we went home saw from my study ealing do its best to rejoice k indeed one fire balloon went so high that l believed it a star but there were none showing today the rain has left us in no doubt that any remaining festivities are to be completely quenched thursday july well the peace at any rate is over though the poor deluded servants are spending their day out on a bus to see the decorations i was right it is a servants peace last night we had forster the bussys it was not the mixture we should have chosen since forster would come out better alone however such are the penalties of owning a press i feel something hke horace walpole who had to limit the visitors to strawberry hill to daily morgan is easily drowned even by the vivacity of the bussys he is an unwordly transparent character whimsical detached caring very little i should think what people say with a clear idea of what he wishes i dont think he wishes to shine in intellectual society certainly not in fashionable he is fantastic very sensitive an attractive character to me though from his very qualities it takes as long to know him as it used to take to put ones gallipot over a humming bird moth more truly he resembles a vaguely rambling butterfly since there is no intensity or rapidity about him to dominate the talk would be odious to him he subsided in a chair or strolled about the room turning over the pages of a book even when the bs had gone we made little direct headway he will come to asheham if we pay his fare he has only in the bank i liked this simple way of explaining things and he hates stevenson makes up his novels as he goes along sees what i mean about dialogue theres a lot to say to him though i dont yet know how to say it its absurd at my age i feel very middle aged to be as easily put out flustered as i am it takes the form of saying things rashly i want to write an article upon you i said that wasnt what i meant to say the woolfs moved from asheham to monks house rodmell on september vw kept no diary between july at hogarth house and y september at monks house from lws diary however we learn that on saturday july james strachey and the shoves came to tea and that on the following day the woolfs had tea with the murrys in hampstead on tuesday july they went to asheham where they had ten days alone hope mirrlees arrived on friday august to stay for the weekend and there was a good deal of coming and going between asheham and charleston where clive and vanessa bell duncan grant and maynard keynes all were on thursday august the woolfs attended the sale of contents at monks house pernel strachey and e m forster stayed at asheham august a dinner party with clive and vanessa duncan roger fry mary hutchinson and maynard keynes as additional guests took place there on sunday th vw wrote the entries from y september to october inclusive in diary viii the titlepage of which is inscribed monks house rodmell sept th sunday september i suppose this is the first day upon which i could easily sit down write in my long suffering by this time i hope tolerant diary the lack of table pen paper ink or rather their dispersion into separate parts of the house was one reason then followed domestic crises which i had foretold but that did not improve their quality when they came now the servants are at charleston mr dedman his brother are naming apple trees in the orchard to leonard if i can resist getting up joining them i may fill this page the move was accomplished in one day thanks chiefly to the organisation of l who tied all the books in lots two waggon loads one leaving about ten another at six did the job we managed to roost about the house somehow or other that night next morning those troubles began which i will not specify further then l had a night in london i sitting down to my book in the dusk heard a voice asking for me k then to my dismay saw the lean fantatical figure of altounyan cross the window he had his wife k friendmontana or fontanaoutside k i had to produce ham k coffee for them k entertain my first visitors a had come from london on purpose to see us on purpose i rather think to discuss the eternal novel once more k perhaps contrive to get it issued by us mrs hamilton has read k found it necessary to quote king lear part of this terrific egotism may be attributed to the armenian half of him i think it is not offensive but would become intensely boring but unhappily people who come all the way from london k walk io miles for the chance of seeing one are almost always bores i set them on their road about ten oclock k could not resist a dark stroll in the garden the temptation whispers from the window all the timeso pleasant to step out onto the lawn walk across to the tool house k survey the downs in day time or the lights of lewes by night much remains to be done inside the house though the main arrangements are now made but for some days ones mind is distracted by perpetually dwelling upon the changes round one it works with an effort this is wearing off slightly though i write this as if i were raising stone on my pen instead of the usual number of ounces however from all the difficulties advantages k disadvantages of the place i think the upshot is wholly favourable one gains much in the way of variety here there are more walks k endless interests in the garden though nothing of the flawless beauty of asheham william dedman a rodmell villager who helped in the garden at monks house ernest altounyan had married in nora die eldest daughter of w g collingwood friend and biographer of ruskin the third visitor has not been identified thursday september the weight upon my mind is lessening though as i have not yet mastered a writing board the long leisurely filling of these blank pages which i promised myself becomes something of a mirage but then duncan nessa have just been over unexpectedly to tea other peoples incursions always leave me tremulous they break in upon a mood of depression deep according to l to me of the consistency of september mist why is it i wonder partly that for io days i dont think ive had a letter then i expect something unpleasant from macmillans here i make my forecast we have read night k day with the deepest interest but hardly think it would appeal to our public over here though i foretell this k see that written down it is negligible as criticism yet i want to have that unpleasant moment over it will infect me for a few days and the publication of n k d may perhaps send an occasional tremor through me for all my boasting if that is pronounced a failure i dont see why i should continue writing novels these are the usual writers melancholies on top of them theres been the move the comparison of this place with asheham servantsk so on writing has been done under difficulties i was making way with my new experiment when i came up against sir thomas browne k found i hadnt read him since i used to dip k duck k be bored k somewhow enchanted hundreds of years ago therefore i had to break off send for his books by the way i have read him fairly often now i come to think of it k start little stories these are always ticklish a bad morning reduces one to melancholy but since i began to write this ive suffered so many interruptions that my mood is no longer benignant i think i shall yield to temptation k see what the sun is doing over the meadows the thousand appliances one needs for writing even a sentence no books from the times either k as for writing a letter i cant bring myself to break the virginity of a sheet of paper saturday september well macmillans letter came this morning k is neither so good nor so bad as it might have been they read with great interest think n k d a fine work but not likely to appeal to a wide public in america k too long to be at this season worth reprinting but they propose to take or sheets from gerald the same number of the voyage out k understand that i will offer them my next book on the whole im rather pleased than otherwise the voyage out will be exhausted certainly this is the only method of becoming known to america presumably macmillans think me worth keeping in view heaven knows when my next novel will be ready the same post brought their refusal of les book they will take sheets of that too it dont much matter i shall accept i suppose since theres scarcely time to try elsewhere but i dont think macmillan had much to do with my depression do i envy nessa her overflowing household perhaps at moments julian has gone into a preparatory form of breeches everything flourishing humane there perhaps i cant help a contrast which never occurs when im in full flood of work i made these comparisons yesterday when i lunched there spent the afternoon rode home by the way im an ingrate to nourish the least private cloud in the face of such brightness of sky the downs all black against scarlet gold as i rode home stopping to look at asheham which had its windows open as if lived in mr geal was going up to pick apples but monks house gives one a pleasant little shock as one opens the gate i found l nelly just back from lewes with her new bicycle he had spent the day in london seven has struck im tempted to walk upon the flats i had meant to say something about these queer spiritual states they interest me even when im the subject and i always remember the saying that at ones lowest ebb one is nearest a true vision i think perhaps people out of ten never get a day in the year of such happiness as i have almost constantly now im having a turn of their lot sunday september well i dont think my turn of their lot is a very serious matter the interesting thing is that one does normally keep up a kind of vibration for no reason whatever equally for no reason whatever the vibration stops then one enquires why one ever had it k there seems no reason why one should ever have it again things seem clear sane comprehensible under no obligation being of that nature to make one vibrate at all indeed its largely the clearness of sight which comes at such seasons that leads to depression but when one can analyse it one is halfway back again i feel unreason slowly tingling in my veins if i could have a good mornings work we went for our first sunday walk today in order to counteract the tremendous draw ofthe garden we have arranged two walks a week on sundays k wednesdays today we went on the downs towards kingston for the first of many days it was cloudy a north east wind a threatening of rain we saw the sea at brighton k the sea at eastbourne to right k left of us the valley slopes behind the down are very lovely the down itself rising to some height but intersected by railings i think the views are finer this side than the other though the downs themselves inferior i must try a little plato nowto prove that concentration is as easy here as elsewhere sunday september why should i pick out the one hour of the week when church bells jangle to go on with this a cold bright sunday very easy today to remember the feel of wintereven the look of the winter earth yesterday as i sat reading nick came knocking at the door i had put away his letter unanswered also apparently unread we had to make ready a room k prepare a crab which he brought as offering he seemed singularly featureless rather like those chubby little village boys one sees with rosy cheeks k red ears staring in at sweet shop windows this is i think much his real character but superimposed is a dab of culture taking the safe direction of th century literature k art thomas gray knew how to write letters from the countryvery witty interesting letters have you ever read thomas gray then jane austen appears she is his great fan as for apples k pears which are now his business his knowledge is limited or perhaps it is due to his thin soiled brain that words are very poverty sticken ideas seem to crawl looking up i saw his face alongside ls k they looked samples of different breeds or widely spaced stages of development here the professor might say pointing his stick at nick is a type of primitive manman yet incapable of concentration or foresight whereas herewell his remarks upon l would be highly complimentary in spite of this grudging scrape of my pen i liked nick quite enough to enjoy seeing him k having a practical k perhaps trained mind we pumped him a good deal about the house he cannot see a cupboard without discovering how it has been built in or a pipe without running his finger along or a brick without lifting it to pry out possible secrets of building he advises as to ask hopes advice barbara arrived for lunch in breeches k jersey scarlet as an apple but maternal to my eye k with her vivid little edge of character distinguishing her from the rest of them she is considerably more distinguished than nick k he recognises this abundantly perhaps his pride is blown upon by the covetous eyes of saxon anyhow he thinks a most remarkable character stamped with the precious mark of gordon squares approval o dearwhen will that mark be rubbed out yet its vain talking what would it profit me to gain the praise ofthe whole world k lose that single voice this reflection is due in part to the memoirs of mrs humphry ward by paying have become a member ofthe lewes public library it is an amusing placefull of old ghosts books half way to decomposition a general brownness covers them they are as much alike outwardly as charity schoolchildren most have shed their boards years ago been recovered in brown paper there is no reason either why mungo park should not be succeeded by the sermons of ebenezer howard then lord morleys recollections then white wings or a swallows summer then treasures ofthe deep thats the sort of thing anyhow i could not resist mrs ward i stand in her unconscionably long hours as if she were a bath of tepid water that one lacks the courage to leave but she set me thinking after tea about fame no one has had a deeper draught of it the poor woman now conscious of a little chill brings out her old praises hangs them out of her front windows see what henry james said of mewalter patergeorge meredith and indeed these poor old grandees solicited i suppose by presentation copies the rest do seem to have perjured themselves cheerfully though i can see them winking my point is however that all this blare pomp has no kind of effect upon the sensitive reader as i claim to be perhaps the winks are too evident the enormous sales the american editions the rumble reverberationpiccadilly placarded with posters marcella outseem like the drum cymbals of a country fair no nothing of this counts she herself setting out to write an intimate account of feelings thoughts gives nothing but bills of fare pass books at what point did she cease thinking long long ago i should say then came to believe implicitly in the mummery names of the great serve as umbrellas covering vacancy but all tea table talk to admonish the young who are i suppose now becoming inquisitive objectionable what a picture though ofthe highest life in intellectual circles in london what a portrait ofthe servants hall with mrs h w for housekeeper uncle matt the master a detestable assembly as she paints it literature served up on plate before them i have gosse to review which makes me rig up some fancy scene as i stumble about the fields to rat farm with l this afternoon found a hawk moth drowned in the brookprivet or what sunday september perhaps the th at least cut off as we are from all human intercourse unless you count the dedmans i cannot be sure even of the date it is said that the entire railways of england are on strike the miners perhaps the transport workers are with them this happened yesterday morning or rather late the night before though we got our papers through late in the evening we are without posts the signalman tom pargiter gave us some information yesterday believes himself to be striking against a reduction of a week in his wages his strike pay comes to a week how with prices what they are the strike can be kept up more than a day or two it is difficult to see he expects a settlement tomorrow but as he hopes it one cant trust him like all the rest he knows far less about the reasons machinations than we dol at any rate at present what with sunday the quiet one imagines on the lines a queer deep silence seems to lie upon us we post letters knowing they wont get further than lewes there is talk of a motor car service the government make a show of courageous determination we are on war rations told to be brave good not since coaching days has the village of rodmell been so isolated as it is at the present moment yet a state of siege has a certain snugness self sufficiency about it no one can interrupt i have given myself a respite from hope mirrlees whose review ought to have been dispatched this morning if it lasts another day or two the food difficulty will begin then theres the question of getting back on thursday until this strike came our main concern has been ls arm a week ago or last monday his wrist arm broke into a rash the dr called it eczema then mrs dedman brushed this aside diagnosed sunflower poisoning l had been uprooting them with bare hands we have accepted her judgment which is confirmed by the case of mrs woolers brother but that doesnt do away with the fact that its a vile irritating disease today for the first time the swelling is less the rash improved but the week has been much damaged in consequence yesterday we went over to asheham plundered the hollow of its mushrooms then got in at the drawing room window gunn is spending on turning it into a rose pink boudoirthat colour at least predominates but they have evidently taken a book of patterns marked out the most respectable bright colours so that the rooms are all as smooth impeccable glossy as can be there are mustard yellows pillar box reds of course i couldnt approve but i should have liked it still less if he had chosen after my own taste the house had looked as dim mysterious as ever i dont know whether its ones accommodating temper that painted the place a little shut in dismal with the vast hollow behind the straight view between trees in front i thought it lacking in variety this time colour but i expect this is one ofthe devices ofthe imagination anyhow monks improves after the fashion of a mongrel who wins your heart i should have said a good deal about the garden only the temptation of being there instead of describing it from within has been too much even for my confirmed habits the green of the turf with the bunch of purple japanese anemones keeps getting in ray eyes we have been planting tiny grains of seed in the front bed in the pious or religious belief that they will resurrect next spring as clarkia calceolaria campanula larkspur scabious i shant recognise them if they do we are planting at a venture inspired by seedsmens language how they stand high bear bright blue petals then theres weeding very soon in any occupation one makes a game of it i mean for im cold inept at the momentchurch bells ringing fire just catching the great log we sawed about to plunge into fiery caverns that one gives characters to weeds the worst is the fine grass which has to be sifted out conscientiously i like uprooting thick dandelions groundsel then the tea bell rings though i sit ponder over my cigarette l runs out like a child allowed to get down go and as i say today were on our island which will be boarded tomorrow oddly enough by clive ive reviewed hope gosse swinnerton all in the past io days so that the great autumn downpour is beginning it crosses my mind now then that night day will be one drop of it but that seems to belong to londonnot here the bore will be meeting people who think they must say that they have not read it perhaps worse that they have that will last six weeks then no more tuesday september this is opened to record the strike bulletin nothing has happened all railways are silent i went into lewes yesterday found a kind of modi fied sunday prevailing shutters half closed at post railway station there were numbers of motors with luggage the pampered rich rumourshop keepers that is to saypredicts a long strike whos in the right they dont say anyhow its bad for us in our private world the discomfort is mostly what we imagine for the future we can make no plans anyhow last night clive did not come thinking this implied disaster to n in london i telegraphed first thing this morning no answer yet its struck seven the papers are just in shrunk to single sheets untrustworthy in their extremedaily mail herald truthful in the middle perhaps daily news so far nothing but persistent hostility on both sides no overtures to increase our private sense of the ominous mr dean chose this day to move the cupboards the house is therefore scattered with books furniture but we gain a dining room to appease us the weather stays fine as possible clear cold still sunny clive stayed at charleston nursing a cold no letters since saturday morning save his card which is local we shall be without butter coffee cigarettes in a day or two getting them from london wednesday october the strike remains so far as we can judge the same on the other hand rumours of the strike change from hour to hour a post came this morning the postman is reported to say that all trains are running as usual the signalman appears situation unchanged much depressed then dedman comes to pick apples a notice is in the post office he says that trains are as usual nelly goes to lewes comes back frightened so she says a few trains only into which you get at your own risk this sickened her of travel which she had been urging an hour before we went down to the signalman with books offers of help his wife met us he being at newhaven a fiery impulsive vigorous woman about to bear her th child she was urging him to give in public opinion was against them she said then she explained that they had only saved shillings with their strike pay this cant long keep off hunger then she couldnt see the rights of it theyre like children whove had their sweet dont want to give up their penny she said often enough to show that shed used the argument often to him they must give it up sooner or later so why not now on returning to hogarth house vw continues her diary in the book she had used from january to july diary vii tuesday y october home yesterday the docile herds whom i describe on peace day are not so deluded after all they have held the country up for eleven days i think we did a little to support them too kept one man on strike who would have gone back without our pound still whats to be read in the papers is hardly fit for my private page i wonder if i could expound the railway strike what they asked what they got at any rate the strike broke in to our life more than the war didbut ive written my diary intermittently have it at rodmell theres a private strike to record too i should like to write philosophically analyse what is no doubt a signdont they call itof the times we must think out our position the question is are we to fling off in a new direction what do we want now at our age where youth is not quite over discretion is fully blown but not long seatedits not so easy to know what one does want i meant to add but that reflections two days old dear old nelly came in shyly like a school girl k asked to apologise last night i see us settled for life with hogarth monks house two domestics i have no time to fill this page since i must read my review book landor read logans stories write a letter or two ive let the time since tea slip began reading the first volume of my diary see that its second anniversary is now reached i dont think the first volume makes such good reading as the last a proof that all writing even this unpremeditated scribbling has its form which one learns is it worth going on with the trouble is that if one goes on a year or so more one will feel bound on that account to continue i wonder why i do it partly i think from my old sense of the race of time times winged chariot hurrying near does it stay it saturday october things are once more in swing though in rather a modified form for me since ive promised to be careful which means avoiding the temptation of london walking down the sunny drives at kew in spite of cold the sun is still the sun of holiday country somehow unfit for the pavement slabs a record autumn for fineness i should think always falsifying the predictions of the times prophet who is gloomy for the first time i went up to london yesterday in the first place to buy gloves in the second to have tea at nessas flat regent square a comfortable party there seated on the kitchen floor julian in a norfolk jacket k eton collar looking a responsible briton quentin still amorphous the dim k dusky flat of jamess day is now at the very opposite pole of culture the pole of sun k brightness the rooms overflow with children the books are the incongruous part of the decoration k nessa professed great contempt for them of course she said theres shakespeare k all that on the bottom shelf but look at that doesnt that give james away he has all the right books neatly ranged but not interesting in the least not i mean all lusty k queer like a writers books the stracheys with the exception of lytton are down in the world lytton we ran into at the club on coming backcomposed agreeable permanently shone upon k completely sure of himselfah but infinitely charming into the bargain success i believe produces a kind of modesty it frees you from bothering about yourself he was flattering to me as usual but then im not a success did i not hear from macmillan today that messrs duckworths charges are prohibitive so my chance of appearing in america is gone but im showered under with review books k though i dont suppose i can pretend that any saying by a publisher is a rebuff still im conscious of being almost proofagainst gordon square i wonder yes i believe that my well of confidence or rather pleasure is so deep sunk as to bubble up in a day or two after any chastening but this i shall soon be able to test my review laboured k well meaning as it was of hopes book has so far drawn no letter of thanks from her im not sure that she didnt cherish some boundless dream about it a whole column in the middle comparing her with the greatest only well ive had my dreams too at the same time im generally rather surprised by the goodness of reality sunday october a gap of more than a week let me see how my hours after tea have been occupied the waterlows came last sunday on monday i went up had my tea at the club k met for a second molly hamilton and whens your novel coming out tuesday i had to read through volumes of an american scribbler sent me by murry wednesday was crammed with george eliot i expect since logan k clive came at thursday i rejoiced in saxon k barbara friday i had tea with nessa k supper too k went to a promenade saturday i heard l say his lecture k then had poor little dorothy hornett up to give her her sweets so here i am with a clear conscience at sunday over my fire waiting for l to come in from sutton clearly i cant go through the list that is an unreasonable demand sydney waterlow is very well pleased with himself yet as his talk becomes more more complacent his prospects more more blooming i always fancy that i can see a slight wobble in what should be the perfect sphere like that which used to foretell the collapse of an air ball he has great designs upon the fo nothing less than complete reformation but if these miscarry he will accept a year in the city but the preposterous man has his endearing absurdity a third project of his is to settle at oare write books in collaboration with desmond for ever he clings to the skirts of the desmonds leonards even virginias im much admired momentarily as if not wholly secure even now she dawks was squat vivacious as usual some of her intelligent remarks fell flat thoughthose supposing a knowledge of sydneys work he is respectful to her in her own department feels that her capacity there is a tribute to him saxon barbara dont need much licking into shape he on the sprightly side she maternal boyish a little to my irritation after all few people dont act a part of some kind logan was rather more aloof distinguished than my memory of him perhaps he disapproved a little of clive clive certainly intended that he should he described his entire indolence then his pleasures we dine not very well then slip into bed together goodness noi dont read on a systemgoodness gracious i dont write every dayso on now logans epicurean life is well regulated self improvement is not despicable in his eyes his conversation is decorous we got out volumes of gibbon they capped passages we have undertaken to get logans stories printed tuesday october this is trafalgar day yesterday is memorable for the appearance of night day my six copies reached me in the morning five were despatched so that i figure the beaks of five friends already imbedded of november kp c wednesday vws article written for the centenary of george eliots birth on november was published in the tls on november kp c friday the promenade concert at the queens hall on the evening of october conducted by sir henry wood contained works by beethoven mozart bach and chopin saturday lws lectureon cooperationwas delivered at sutton on sunday dorothy hornett has not been identified am i nervous oddly little more excited pleased than nervous in the first place there it is out done with then i read a bit liked it then i have a kind of confidence that the people whose judgment i value will probably think well of it which is much reinforced by the knowledge that even if they dont i shall pick up start another story on my own of course if morgan lytton the others should be enthusiastic i should think the better of myself the bore is meeting people who say the usual things but on the whole i see what im aiming at what i feel is that this time ive had a fair chance done my best so that i can be philosophic lay the blame on god lovely autumn days come one after another the leaves hanging like rare gold coins on the trees clive was at the club yesterday k talked ostensibly to me but to the whole room in reality some of whom judged him a little bounder i suppose turned round thanked god when he left the room yes i should like a good long review in the times thursday october the first fruits of night day must be entered no doubt a work of the highest genius clive bell well he might not have liked it he was critical of the voyage out i own im pleased yet not convinced that it is as he says however this is a token that im right to have no fears the people whose judgment i respect wont be so enthusiastic as he is but theyll come out decidedly on that side i think moreover in a way which i cant defend to l i do respect clives judgment its erratic but always springs from a direct feeling i think i feel most doubtful about morgan after getting his report i shall be quite at ease three or four people count the rest save as a senseless clapping of hands or hissing are nowhere no one of much intelligence outside my own friends is likely to read a very long novel but i must stop im at my hack work ka dines here i cant spare time to describe my concert last night only room for my own praises besides i must thank c thursday october have the excuse of rheumatism for not writing more my hand tired of writing apart from rheumatism still if i could treat myself professionally as a subject for analysis i could make an interesting story ofthe past few days of my vicissitudes about n d after clives letter came nessasunstinted praise on top of that lyttons enthusiastic praise a grand triumph a classic so on violets sentence of eulogy followed then yesterday morning this line from morgan i like it less than the vo though he spoke also of great admiration had read in haste proposed rereading this rubbed out all the pleasure of the rest yes but to continue about in the afternoon i felt happier easier on account of his blame than on account of the others praiseas if one were in the human atmosphere again after a blissful roll among elastic clouds cushiony downs yet i suppose i value morgans opinion as much as anybodies then theres a column in the times this morning high praise intelligent too saying among other things that n d though it has less brilliance on the surface has more depth than the other with which i agree i hope this week will see me through the reviews i should like intelligent letters to follow but i want to be writing little stories i feel a load off my mind all the same the rheumatism made me visit the region which is in my mind the mediaeval region clive burst in i was going to say like a ruddy sun last night but i wasnt altogether in the mood nor he either the most selfish of men in some ways though i dont know why that struck me letting his mood have its way indifferent frivolous but i pinned him down made him talk about n d which he did absentmindedly at first later he warmed to his task but he was thinking ofa jolly time in paris saturday november shall i ever again get time for writing here never have i been so pressed with reviewing for theres george eliot to fill up all crannies left by other books murry to choke effectually any empty space remaining i think i might slack off if n d succeeds no more letters or reviews a cheque for though on copies sold before publication happily the book begins to recede from the front of my mind i begin to be a little surprised if people speak of it not that anyone hasbut meeting mde champcomunal yesterday i was glad shed not heard of it this lady whose name i shall never write again wishes to share tregerthen the plan may be the perfect one she is a grenadier of a woman high red cheek bones thin competent handsome unhappy tailor made up to date i met her at regent squareall lights out a single candle electricians insistent sometimes i wish that the old laws of life held good a husband a house servants establishments that same afternoon i looked in at the london group but saw nothing save people i had no wish to see ran into noel olivier walking through the squares november descends squires new monthly the london mercury out and now middlemarch tuesday november and now i only steal time from an hour dedicated to stokoes poems before miss green arrives we plod off in the foggy cold to address the guild upon the russian revolution the hard scrubbed surface of the lower middle class mind does not attract me this refers partly to mr osborne im critical intellectually of the aristocrats but sensually they charm i was hauled out of the background to talk to katie at the richmonds concert on sunday her beautiful blue eyes all bleared blood shot now her skin soft like the skin on an old apple like an apples creased at the edge of the mouth baggy here there what sorrow she has had to make her look sad i dont know the following dialogue went forward k the cecils have given up their housecouldnt afford it v but he has a year k no such thing besides everyone must economise my dear virginia the end is coming a la lanterne v for you i daresay not for me k ah theres where you mistake i go first but you directly after v well after years of longleat you deserve it k it was so beautifulyou dont know how beautiful v you rode k i walked in the woods we had music i used to read always beautiful things to look at always something new never the same things twice over i had it for years i used to say i wished i could die when it was over i wish i had v but you havent done so badly k i didnt care for egypt i dont care for that sort of thing men running before my carriage i envied themthe only people who got any exercise civilisation is at an end my father always warned us ive read history were all going to go painters will be the only people wantedto paint bodies pretty patterns no one means to work therell be no clothes so we talked in the intervals of mozart this is the daily talk in mayfair i suppose she seemed to be convinced of it almost grown indifferent her one desire to save something for her son to die before the crash but spoken with a kind of humorous resignation which foretells a gallant death on the scaffold thursday november sydney morgan dined with us last night on the whole im glad i sacrificed a concert the doubt about morgan n d is removed i understand why he likes it less than vo in understanding see that it is not a criticism to discourage perhaps intelligent criticism never is all the same i shirk writing it out because i write so much criticism what he said amounted to this n d is a strictly formal classical work that being so one requires or he requires a far greater degree of lovabilility in the characters than in a book like vo which is vague universal none of the characters in n d is lovable he did not care how they sorted themselves out neither did he care for the characters in vo but there he felt no need to care for them otherwise he admired practically everything his blame does not consist in saying that n d is less remarkable than tother o beauties it has in plentyin fact i see no reason to be depressed on his account sidney said he had been completely upset by it was of opinion that i had on this occasion brought it off but what a bore im becoming yes even old virginia will skip a good deal of this but at the moment it seems important the cambridge magazine repeats what morgan said about dislike of the characters yet i am in the forefront of contemporary literature im cynical about my figures they say but directly they go into detail morgan who read the review sitting over the gas fire began to disagree so all critics split off the wretched author who tries to keep control of them is torn asunder for the first time this many years i walked along the river bank between ten eleven yes its like the shut up house i once compared it to the room with its dust sheets on the chairs the fishermen are not out so early an empty path but a large aeroplane on business we talked very easily the proof being that we i anyhow did not mind silences morgan lady cromer died in her son was the hon evelyn baring later st baron howick of glendale a long review oi night and day entitled beality and dream was featured on the first page of the cambridge magazine for november it was written by e b c jones has the artists mind he says the simple things that clever people dont say i find him the best of critics for that reason suddenly out comes the obvious thing that one has overlooked he is in trouble with a novel of his own fingering the keys but only producing discords so far he is anxious to begin again moderate reviewing we timed our walk admirably for him to catch his train we have promised to go to the hutchinsons tonight but as l is at the famine conference theres something disagreeable to me about that circle which makes me reluctant to go alone i dont suppose we shall saturday november it is true that i have never been so neglectful of this work of mine i think i can foresee in my reluctance to trace a sentence not merely lack of time a mind tired of writing but also one of those slight distastes which betokens a change of style so an animal must feel at the approach of spring when his coat changes will it always be the same shall i always feel this quicksilver surface in my language always be shaking it from shape to shape but if this is so it is only part cause of my neglect there have been substantial difficulties we were with lytton last sunday on monday i was at harrisons back just in time for moll h to distinguish her from molly m tuesday i wrote letters wednesday at a concert with violet dickinson immediately after thursday molly m for tea after tea friday to margaret lilian so here i am sitting after saturday tea a large warm meal full of currants sugar hot tea cake after a long cold walk if i shut my eyes thought of tidmarsh what should i see carrington a little absorbed with household duties secreting canvas in the attic saxon mute sealed till sunday night when he flowered for a time talked of greek lyttona more complex situation good simple tendera little low in tone a little invalidish if id married him i caught myself thinking i should have found him querulous he would have laid too many ties on one repined a little if one had broken free he was in his usual health as they say but the sense of living so much for health assembling so many comforts round him with that object is a little depressing but i always qualify these strictures which im quick to find i know with some subconscious idea of justifying myself i need no justification and what i feel for lytton is as true as ever it was we sit alone over the fire rattle on so quick so agile in our jumps circumventions lytton i suppose if one could dissolve all extraneous surroundings has in the centre of him a great passion for the mind he cares for more than literature only on his table were the latest editions of voltaire his books were as primly ranged carefully tended as an old maids china he talked of his own work not optimistically but one must discount the effect of my perhaps excessive optimism about my own writing i was in the vein to feel very highly creative as indeed he said he thought me but he declares himself entirely without that power he can invent nothing he says take away his authorities he comes to a full stop perhaps this is true of all stracheys accounts for the queer feelingwhich i will not analyse since in lyttons case the rightness the subtlety the fineness of his mind quite overcome my furtive discomfort moll h still strains at her leash like the spaniel of my legend but foams with enthusiasm for n d it is a rough eager mind bold straightforward but o dearwhen it comes to writing her courage impresses me the sense she gives of a machine working at high pressure all day longthe ordinary able machine of the professional working woman a tailor made coat costing is essential she said to exact respect in an office that shows her competent grasp upon life but why do i always like people so throw out my judgments it is true that i always do i think violet dickinson must be skipped save that i may note how she has been grave finding in france planting lady horners rosemarys upon german tombs all this she enjoyed highly in her humorous sporting way had been most touched by an inscription she found telling how ainsworth ofthe hussars had loved his life loved his horse dog so we skip to molly who took her tea in the kitchen drew an amusing sketch of uncle gerald ritchie gone mad rushing in taxis from fruiterer to fruiterer to buy melons which he showers on his friends in an ecstasy of good temper pronounced madness by the doctors since he is positively rude to his wife lastly we approach the heights of hampsteadthe immaculate moral heights of hampstead had i the energy left i would write out that scene of revelation explanation with margaret since in minutes we traversed more ground than in the past years tentatively she began ithow janet she felt that perhapsthey might be wrong but still in their viewin short my article on charlotte bronte was so much more to their liking than my novels something in my feeling for human beingssome narrownesssome lack of emotion here i blazed up let fly so you go on preaching humanity was the gist of what i said when youve withdrawn preserve only the conventional idea of it but its you that are narrow she retaliated on the contrary i shiver shrink with the oncoming contest as i step up your stairs i but im the most sympathetic the most human the most universal of people you grant that janet moralises i said o yes she granted that readily but the idea of herself as a forcible intense woman excluding the greater half of the human heart staggered her she took the blow well it was as if one had suddenly drawn some curtain she must think it over write to me she said i plunged down the hill to lilians bedside she in her serene quiet way said ah im glad you told margaret that she never will let me say it friday november this gap can easily be accounted for by recalling the old saying if it is one that when things happen people dont write too many things have happened within this last fortnight the international review has come to an end both servants are going two publishers have offered to publish n d v o in america angelica has stayed with us mrs brewer has told us that she means to sell hogarth suffield we are considering buying them bothtogether with a greater number than usual of diners letters telephone calls books to review reviews of my book invitations to parties k so forth it was the dinner parties that led nelly to give notice last monday she did it in a tentative boastful way as if to show off to someone behind the scenes which makes me think she would be glad now to change her mind she would this moment if i asked her but on the whole im not going to ask her let alone the recurring worry of these scenes we both incline to try a new system of dailies which never ceases to attract us what with rodmell a lower income from the ir now becomes desirable my opinion never changes that our domestic system is wrong to go on saying this only breeds irritation we mean to make the attempt now no one could be nicer than nelly for long stretches at this moment she gives angelica her bath is perfectly friendly considerate to me but think of rodmellthink of the summer she offered to go to charleston the drawbacks are too great but the fault is more in the system of keeping two young women chained in a kitchen to laze work suck their life from two in the drawing room than in her character or in mine perhaps i think this our chief event since i put it first but the chief event should be the ir im on the whole glad that we draw our for half ls work that is the solution so faran amalgamation with the contemporary so many afternoons i walked alone so many evenings l sat reading proofs or papers to me the red magazine on the first of the month seemed scarcely worth all of him that he gave but then to have thrown that away is galling too the rowntrees methods of making arrangements is to smash everything with his heavy hooves then i was considerably pleased with the american publishers that the old vo should set sail again it is like going into another form mrs woolf you are now admitted to our society yet that sort of compliment means very little so far as praise goes nor was i elated for more than hours by eagle j c squires invitation to make his broad yellow production my mouthpiece km wrote a review which irritated mei thought i saw spite in it a decorous elderly dullard she describes me jane austen up to date leonard supposes that she let her wish for my failure have its way with her pen he could see her looking about for a loophole of escape im not going to call this a successor if i must ill call it the wrong kind of success i need not now spread my charity so wide since lws annual salary as editor ofthe international review was a rate at which he was retained when the periodical was taken over by another of arnold rowntrees interests the monthly contemporary review in and lw regularly contributed an unsigned section called the world of nations facts and documents in this was superseded by a signed monthly article entitled foreign affairs for this he received pa see ivlw pp the negotiations between duckworth and macmillan new york for the american publication of the voyage out and night and day were overtaken by more favourable proposals from george h doran of new york who became vws first american publishers katherine mansfields review of night and day appeared in the athenaeum of november december murry tells me she is practically cured but what i perceive in all this is that praise hardly warms blame stings far more keenly k both are somehow at arms length yet its on the cards i suppose that n d is a marked success i expect a letter every day from someone or other now i can write with the sense of many people willing to read its all pleasant lights up the first sentences of my writing of a morning today bearing km in mind i refused to do dorothy richardson for the supt the truth is that when i looked at it i felt myself looking for faults hoping for them and they would have bent my pen i know there must be an instinct of selfpreservation at work if shes good then im not im pained to read praise of legend a book by clemence dane but it looks as if i had a soul after all these are revelations self analyses im reading ethel smyth i wish it were betterodd that i wrote that genuinely meaning it but i couldnt have done so with the novels what a subject that one should see it as a superb subject is a tribute to her but of course not knowing how to write shes muffed it the interest remains because she has ridden straight at her recollections never swerving getting through honestly capably but without the power to still shape the past so that one will wish to read it again honesty is her quality the fact that she made a great rush at life friendships with women interest me friday december another of these skips but i think the book draws its breath steadily if with deliberation i reflect that ive not opened a greek book since we came back hardly read outside my review books which proves that my time for writing has not been mine at all this last week l has been having a little temperature in the evening due to malaria that due to a visit to oxford a place of death decay im almost alarmed to see how entirely my weight rests on his prop and almost alarmed to find how intensely im specialised my mind turned by anxiety or other cause from its scrutiny of blank paper is like a lost childwandering the house sitting on the bottom step to cry night day flutters about me still causes great loss of time george eliot would never read reviews since talk of her books hampered her writing i begin to see what she meant i dont take praise or blame excessively to heart but they interrupt cast ones eyes backwards make one wish to explain or investigate last week i had a cutting paragraph to myself in wayfarer this week olive heseltine applies balm but i had rather write in my own way of four passionate snails than be as km maintains jane austen over again saturday december on tuesday i lunched with the cecils perhaps this is my first appearance as a small lioness the bibescos wished to meet me lord cranborne has a great admiration for me elizabeth was nicer less brilliant than i expected she has the composed manners of a matron did not strain to say clever things i thought her slightly nervous when we drew into the window to talk perhaps she does not like the womans eye to rest upon her she is pasty podgy with the eyes of currant bun suddenly protruding with animation but her animation is the product of a highly trained mind a mind trained by living perpetually among more highly trained minds memory comes to take the place of character in the old she said discussing lady d nevill again its a help to write things down but theres a gulf between writing publishing this was said i remember owing to my rash abuse of lady glenconner wyndham tennanther aunt of course she turned round a little uneasily to disclaim all admiration for lady g i suppose she wishes to stand well with the intellectuals bibesco is handsome amiable a man rather too much of the smooth opulent world to be of particular interest his english is too difficult to let one get straight at him like all foreigners he says serious priggish thingsi prefer to believe nothing save what my reason can confirmor words to that effect lord robert was congenial as usual long loose friendly humorous in spite of the crucifix on his watch chain lord cranbourne much ofa cecil in appearance modest gentle with a long sallow face no chin shiny blue coat trousers he had been to a lecture at the london school of economics i stayed talking with nelly when the rest were goneabout adders about servants george eliot night day sunday december probably the last entry this year not likely to be the most articulate twenty two days gap to be accounted for chiefly by illness first ls which dribbled on then much in the same way i was attacked days in bed down today on the sofa away to monks house tomorrow it was influenzawhat they call a low type but prolonged sponging on the head as it always does not much to say therefore even if i could say it indeed since l started his malarial type weve seen few people i for the last io days none at all but ive read two vast volumes ofthe life of butler am racing through greville memoirsboth superbly fit for illness butler has the effect of paring the bark off feelings all left a little raw but vivida lack of sap though a stage so thinly set as to be dull bone dry towards the finish im struck by the enormous space his fame books played in a life so bare of human relations isnt this reputation the deepest of all masculine instincts almost at the end when people began to praise his life put forth a little flower but too late for such a critical contemptuous mind the value attached to reviews seems queer why i dont think half or quarter so much of mine but then he had indifference silence for his lot perhaps the most trying it dont the life i mean increase ones respect for human nature here was someone i expected to admire greatly the pettinesses are therefore more devastating than in the case of another festing jones apes him to perfection an effective style in its way save that it becomes too mechanical here i run on but must stop oh yes ive enjoyed reading the past years diary k shall keep it up im amused to find how its grown a person with almost a face of its own ls book not yet out but we have six copies in advance negotiations proceeding for the sale of hyde park gate the purchase of this
