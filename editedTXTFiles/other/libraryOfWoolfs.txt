INTRODUCTION
This catalogue comprises a selection of books from the library of the late Leonard Woolf taken from Monks House, Rodmell, Sussex, and from 24, Victoria Square, London.
Monks House was the country home of Leonard and Virginia from 1919 until 1941 when Virginia took her own life.    Leonard continued to live there until his death on the 14th August 1969. Long before the acquisition of Monks House members of the Bloomsbury Group had adopted the area of Sussex between Lewes and Firle Beacon as their country venue.   Leonard and Virginia had rented Asham House from 1911 to 1919 and Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant had lived at Charleston Farm since 1916.
The house in Victoria Square was Leonard's third and last London home after leaving Hogarth House, Richmond, Surrey, in 1924.    He acquired the lease in 1941 after the bombing of 37, Mecklenburg Square.
The combined total of books in Monks House and Victoria Square at the time of Leonard's death was probably about 9,000 volumes.    There is reason to believe however that at one time the library was considerably larger.
When Leonard left Cambridge in 1904 he became an Assistant Government Agent in Ceylon and married Virginia in 1912, the year after he returned to England.    This would have been the occasion of the formation of their joint library.    Virginia had her own collection of books together with a large number of volumes from her father's library,  while Leonard's contribution would have been his school and university books and his collection of works on Ceylon.   This nucleus must have graced the shelves of Hogarth House their home in Richmond from 1915 to 1924 and it was here they started the Hogarth Press in 1917.
In 1924 they moved to 52, Tavistock Square,  where they continued to run and develop the Hogarth Press.
With their joint publishing and literary activities, the reviewing of literary works by Virginia and of political, sociological and economic books by Leonard, their library must have grown enormously in the 1920's.   There is, in fact, considerable evidence to show that in a short space of time between 1928 and 1929 they numbered a large part of their library and the pencilled numbers on front end papers and title pages suggest that this portion was about 15,000 volumes.    Many early volumes, e.g. those from Leslie Stephen's library,  were not numbered so their total number of bc^ks at that time could have been considerably in excess of this figure.
- 2 -
What the purpose of the numbering was is not known but it was, as far as we can judge, a haphazard operation.- See Liddell and Scott "A Greek English Lexicon"   Parts 1 - 4 (V/s Sect.  5   p. 71) and Toynbee A.J.    "Survey of International Affairs"    13 vols. (V/s Sect.   5   p. 7 5).
From time to time Leonard sold duplicates and review copies off to members of the Secondhand Book Trade.    There is interesting evidence of this in 1940 in a postcard found inserted in a copy of Gustav Stresemann's "His Diaries, Letters and Papers"  (V/s   Sect.  3   p. 8) on which Leonard refers to some books
left in a garage    ".....among the books is one Gustav Stresemann,
which I want to keep.   All the others can be sold."
Two other events may have been factors in reducing the library to the 9,000 volumes at the time of Leonard's death. The first was the move from Tavistock Square where they had lived for 15 years.    One may reasonably assume that this was an occasion for pruning the library and so reducing the number of volumes to be moved to Mecklenburg Square.    The second event was the bombing of 37, Mecklenburg Square in 1941.    Leonard's account of the damage leaves little doubt that many books were destroyed and others damaged beyond repair.    The remaining volumes, many damaged and damp stained,  were salvaged and taken to Monks House.
The condition of a large portion of the library is poor.    It was always essentially a working library and neither Leonard nor Virginia cared for fine books or collectors' pieces.   No books were kept behind glass and no item was specially cared for.    All were on open shelves and became faded and dusty.   These facts, together with war damage, account for the poor state of numerous volumes and for the attempts made by Virginia to re-cover and label many of them.
In September 1969, a month after Leonard's death,  George Holleyman valued the library at Monks House for probate purposes. At that time it comprised approx.  5/6,000 volumes.    Every room contained books, and the distribution was roughly as follows:-
GROUND FLOOR
THE APPLE ROOM  (formerly used as a dining room) French Literature, sets and paper bound volumes, Chatto and Windus publications, general literature, a collection of books on Ceylon and about 100 Loeb Classics.
THE GARDEN ROOM  (used as a bedroom by Virginia)   Virginia's works in all languages, including first editions, signed editions and reprints, the Dictionary of National Biography which had belonged to her father, literary criticism and miscellaneous literature.
- 3 -
FIRST FLOOR
LANDING.    History,  sets, quartos, folios,  &c.
LEONARD'S BEDROOM  (formerly used as a study) Reference Works, dictionaries, Baedeker Guides, &c.    Literary criticism and biography, political and sociological works, history, Greek and Latin classics , pocket editions , &c.
SITTING ROOM  (above Garden Room)    Press Books, sets, Bloomsbury Group first editions,  17th and 18th century books, &c.
SECOND FLOOR
THE WORK ROOM   Poetry,   novels, first editions, literary criticism , Leonard Woolf first editions and reprints, standard authors,  &c.
Mrs. Trekkie Parsons  (see Leonard Woolf's Autobiography vol.5) who inherited the house and its contents, disposed of the library as follows:
All Virginia first editions,  signed editions and reprints and translations into several languages, together with a set of Leonard Woolf's works were presented to Sussex University.    The Virginia collection is far from being complete.
About this time Mrs.  Parsons also made a gift to Professor Quentin Bell of about IOO volumes which included a number of works by Leslie Stephen - mostly first editions and association copies together with other works by members of the Stephen family.
Approximately 325 books were consigned to sale at Sotheby's. A first lot of about 250 volumes, almost entirely limited to works of the 20th century,  was sold on April 27th,  1970 for £9,400. Included among them were signed presentation copies of the works of Elizabeth Bowen, E.M. Forster, Lytton Strachey, T.S. Eliot, Robinson Jeffers, Thomas Hardy, Henry James and the Sitwells. Most of these were purchased by the House of Ei Dieff (L.D. Feldman) of New York City, acting for the University of Texas. The highest price at this sale was £620 for a signed presentation copy to Virginia of Lytton Strachey's "Queen Victoria".   The manuscript of this work was already in the possession of the University of Texas.    The second sale of Monks House books on July 27th,  1970  (items 130-174 "The Property of a Lady") realised a total of £2,400.   This sale contained a few 20th century books but were mostly earlier works, including first editions of Jane Austen,
- 4 -
Thomas Browne,  George Eliot, Thomas Love Peacock and William Wordsworth.    A presentation copy of Darwin's "Origin of Species" inscribed by the author to Leslie Stephen fetched £45.    A first edition of Gentilis'  "Regales Disputationes Tres" bearing the signature and notes of John Donne,  went for £480. The next highest price was for Leslie Stephen's copy of Pope's "An Essay on Man" bound in one volume with first editions of other 18th century works.    The nine first editions of Thomas Love Peacock brought, in aggregate,  £632.
The residue from Monks House was divided into two portions.   The first purchased by Bow Windows Bookshop, Lewes (details of which are not included in this catalogue) and the second by Holleyman & Treacher Ltd. , Brighton, who in May 1970 issued a catalogue entitled "Monks House Catalogue -Important and Association Books from the Library of Virginia & Leonard Woolf", comprising 742 items, totalling 1,149 volumes.
Only a collection of Hogarth Press publications remained in the house  (sold to Washington State University, U.S.A. in 1974).
Some idea of the composition of this library has been given above and reflects the careers and principal interests of Leonard and Virginia.    Some of the earlier items came from the library of Sir Leslie Stephen (Virginia's father) which Virginia inherited on his death in 1904, and some volumes bear his signature and notes. Included among these is his set of the Dictionary of National Biography of which he was the first Editor from 1882 to 1889.
Sir Leslie Stephen's first wife was Harriet Marian Thackeray (Minnie), daughter of William Makepeace Thackeray, and among the volumes is his first book published anonymously when he was a Don at Cambridge and presented to the two daughters of Thackeray, one of whom he subsequently married.   (M/H Sect. 1   p.i).
Leslie Stephen's second wife whom he married in 1878 was Julia Prinsep Duckworth,  widow of Herbert Duckworth.    Some items bear signatures of the Duckworth family.
The children of this second marriage were Vanessa, Virginia, Thoby and Adrian.
Whilst at Trinity College, Cambridge (1899-1904) Leonard Woolf became friendly with Thoby Stephen and through him met his sisters Vanessa and Virginia.    Books of this period bear the signatures of Thoby Stephen and Adeline Virginia Stephen.
- 5 -
Many Greek and Latin Classics of the Cambridge days bear the signature of Leonard Woolf as well as notes and translations in his hand.
A law suit brought against Mrs.  Parsons by Cecil Woolf (nephew of Leonard) prevented the disposal of the books in the London House at 24 Victoria Square until September 1971,  when the suit was settled in favour of Mrs.  Parsons.
The first inspection of the Victoria Square Library was made by George Holleyman in September 1971.    Its composition, distribution and condition were in every way reminiscent of the Monks House library.    Some effort at classification had once been attempted but had obviously been abandoned for many years.
One wall of the basement passage was thickly packed with dust laden volumes giving off a dampish odour.    The front room on the ground floor with two walls completely shelved, housed sets of French classics and a fair number of Leonard's review copies, but mixed with miscellaneous works from various sources.    The back ground floor room with one wall completely shelved together with a large book-case in the hall was packed with volumes from the library of Leslie Stephen.    These collections were in a considerable state of disorder with odd volumes, detached covers and dust everywhere.   A further batch of works from Leslie Stephen's library was in book-cases in the large drawing room on the first floor,  where the walls were hung with paintings by Vanessa Bell, Duncan Grant and Trekkie Parsons. A fourth cache in one of the upstairs bedrooms contained some of Leslie Stephen's books on mountaineering.    The top floor of the house,  which had been occupied by Duncan Grant,  was empty.
On October 10th 1971, this library, having been purchased by Holleyman & Treacher Ltd. ,  was removed to Brighton and on March 31st 1972 the Victoria Square catalogue was completed. It comprised 1,87 5 items containing 2,681 volumes.    It is not only complimentary to the Monks House library but an integral part of it.   All seven groups in the Monks House catalogue are repeated but with a major difference - Section 1 "Early items from the library of Leslie Stephen etc. " is very much larger, comprising 520 items (977 volumes).    Here we find in rows of dust-begrimed volumes the literary ancestry of Virginia Woolf - for these were books she inherited from her father and among them are books which Leslie Stephen inherited from his father and grandfather, and one which probably belonged to his great-grandfather.    (Carew's Survey of Cornwall 17 69. V/s Sect. 1 p. 2 6).    Books written by his father,
- 6 -
his uncles and his cousins - the Diceys, the Venns and the Stephens are all represented and it is interesting to note that a number of these books written by Leslie Stephen and the family were specially bound in half brown morocco.    Books by his Quaker sister - Caroline.    Books which came into Leslie Stephen's library through his first wife Minnie, daughter of William Makepeace Thackeray, including Thackeray's own copies of Fielding's first edition of Tom Jones and Amelia.    Books which Leslie Stephen gave to the daughter of his first marriage, Laura Makepeace Stephen, in which he had written her name.    Books by Anne Ritchie (nee Anne Thackeray) Leslie Stephen's sister-in-law by his first marriage and books which belonged to Herbert Duckworth and the Jacksons which would have been added to the library on the occasion of Leslie Stephen's marriage to Julia Prinsep Duckworth (nee Jackson) in 1878.
Throughout the collection we find a series of School Prizes to Leslie Stephen when at his Prep. School in Brighton,  prizes he received at Eton and a collection of books presented to him when he relinquished his lectureship at Trinity Hall, Cambridge -these bearing a bookplate "Leslie Stephen from Trinity Hall friends 1867".   We also become intimately aware of Leslie Stephen's special friends, Matthew Arnold, Charles Darwin, CE. Norton, Russell Lowell, Thomas Carlyle, John Stuart Mill, A.W. Kinglake, Oliver Wendell Holmes &c. , many of the books being signed presentation copies.
In addition there was a nucleus of the works of standard English and French authors, including leather bound sets of the 18th &  19th centuries.    Many of these bear the signature and annotations of Leslie Stephen and among them may be mentioned the set of Walter Scott - "the long line of red backs" so much beloved by their owner.    (V/s Sect.l p. 67).   Also works of Swift, Johnson,  Bacon,  Burke, Coleridge &c.
Evidence of Russell Lowell's special regard for Julia is seen in four signed presentation copies to her (V/s Sect. 1 p. 5 & M/H Sect. 1 p. 3).    This friendship was described by Maitland in his "Life and Letters of Leslie Stephen" published in 1906 two years after Leslie's death (p. 317-319).    In this book Maitland published in full the prophetic poem sent by Lowell to Julia with a silver posset dish at the time of Virginia's birth.    A complete text of this poem appears in the hand of Leslie Stephen on the front end papers of "Lowells Letters" edited by CE. Norton 1894, together with some notes which suggest Leslie Stephen was unaware of the poem until after Julia's death in 1895 (V/s Sect. 1 p. 64-66).

A considerable number of volumes contained the excellent pencil drawings of animals which, according to Maitland, Leslie Stephen drew to amuse children.    He was also an accomplished writer of shorthand and Maitland recalls "His mother being a Venn, could write shorthand, and she taught her children to write it.   In 18 52 she remarked that within the last few months both her sons had taken it into their heads to practise shorthand again and both now write to us in that language;   an immense improvement.    We have much longer letters than we used. "   Shorthand notes appear in many of Leslie Stephen's books.
Maitland also recalls that during Leslie Stephen's last days a notebook was kept at his bedside and one of his final entries
was ".....my books as you know are mangy and worthless.    I
should sell them for what they would fetch after taking out a few that may interest you."   We now know that over 1,000 volumes have survived, many of them patched and rehabilitated by Virginia. This assessment of the value of his library by Leslie Stephen contrasts strangely with Leonard Woolf's account of the books inherited by Virginia, in his Autobiography (Vol.5 p.65 &  66).    He is referring to the removal of books from London to Monks House after the bombing of Mecklenburg Square in 1940. -"In a large ground floor sitting room of Monks House the thousands of books which we had in London were piled on tables, chairs, and all over the floor.    I had always had a passion for buying and accumulating books and so had Virginia but she had also inherited her father's library.    This was the kind of library which, in the spacious and affluent days of Queen Victoria, a distinguished gentleman,  who edited the Dictionary of National Biography and was an eminent critic and essayist,  was apt to acquire.   There upon his shelves in complete editions of 10, 20, 30 or 40 volumes, often pompously bound in calf stood the rows of English and French classics".
With a final quotation from Maitland we leave the literary possessions of Leslie Stephen.    "This true lover of books, I may observe had not in him one spark of bibliolatry or bibliomania. His books, for by 'books' he meant corporeal things,  were, as he said, a 'mangy' lot and he did not treat them tenderly.    He drew pictures on fly-leaves, and the volumes that he had in use lay about on the floor around the rocking chair".
Also in this section is a selection of books Virginia must have acquired on the death of her brother Thoby in 1906, some of these also containing pencil drawings of animals, but principally birds, showing that Thoby had the same artistic idiosyncracy as his father.

Earlier in this preface attention has been drawn to Virginia's book-binding and repairing activities.    It was assumed that most of these efforts were concerned with re-covering and preserving books which had been damaged when Mecklenburg Square was bombed in 1940.    Examination of the hundreds of books from Victoria Square however, has shown that these activities go back to much earlier days.    Professor Quentin Bell tells us that Virginia and her friend Emma Vaughan took a course in book-binding. (A copy of Douglas Cockerell's "Book-binding and the care of Books" 1901 was found in Victoria Square  (V/s Sect. 2 p. 3).   A great many of her father's books were roughly repaired by having thin strips of leather pasted over the spine and new paper labels hand-written in ink by Virginia.
An interesting and we presume early example of Virginia's binding is found in the seven volumes of Arber's "English Garner" (V/s Sect. 7 p. 5).    One of the better bound volumes is signed on the spine with a gilt embossed monogram of a heart enclosing the letter "V".
Some of the coloured papers used by Virginia were wood block printed "Rizzi" Italian papers,  whereas others were probably taken from the stock of papers used for binding Hogarth Press books - some of which were purchased locally from Stationers' shops. (Kirkpatrick's Bibliography of Virginia Woolf p.7).
One of the most interesting examples of Virginia's binding is a copy of Dickens's "Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby". This has been covered with a blue linen cloth on which the words "Two Stories" had been printed in black ink.   This was certainly a rejected cover intended for binding a copy of Leonard & Virginia's "Two Stories" the first book ever to be published by the Hogarth Press, in 1917  (V/s Sect. 7 p. 6).
In Section 2 of both catalogues "Items Belonging to or Presented to Virginia Woolf" there is evidence that in her early years Virginia had bookplates specially designed for her own use. Nine examples of a sepia bookplate with a rose and the initials AVS are recorded, but only one of a similar plate portraying a nude woman, has survived.    (M/H Sect.2 p.2 Euripides).    Nearly all these bookplates have been damaged in an attempt to remove or obliterate them.   Twenty-one examples of an heraldic bookplate showing a crest and the initials AVS together with the motto "In tali nunquam lassat venatio Silva" are present.    This crest was copied from the bookplate of James Stephen Jr.   1748-1832  (Virginia's great grandfather)  (V/s Sect.l p.35 - Montesquieu).    Even this bookplate was abandoned and some of them have been found damaged.
- 9 -
A number of books have the "AVS" cut from this bookplate pasted inside the front cover (V/s Sect. 2 p. 4 - Various Authors). Several small bookplates, some with the date inserted by hand, and a few handwritten bookplates are recorded.    All Virginia's bookplates belong to the period before her marriage to Leonard Woolf.
Books belonging to and associated with Leonard Woolf are strongly represented in both the Monks House and Victoria Square libraries  (Sections 3 & 6).    Perhaps the most interesting item is the set of Voltaire which Leonard Woolf took with him to Ceylon in 1904 and which is mentioned several times in Vol.2 of his autobiography.   (Sect. 2 p. 16 &  17).
An additional Section - No.  8 - has been included in the Victoria Square catalogue.    These are items from the library of Prof. & Mrs. Quentin Bell.    Several of these books came from the library of Leslie Stephen and must have passed into the possession of Prof. Quentin Bell through his mother Vanessa, elder daughter of Leslie Stephen.   The most important of these is a set of the works of William Makepeace Thackeray in 22 volumes containing many notes and drawings by Leslie Stephen (V/s Sect. 3 p. 2 & 3). There are also books which belonged to Thoby Stephen, Lytton Strachey - each with an early bookplate designed by Halsey Richardo - and a number of volumes which came from the library of Clive Bell (Quentin's father) including his own copy of a first edition of D.H. Lawrence's "Lady Chatterley's Lover" which he refers to in his book entitled "Old Friends".    Other items belonged to Julian Bell (eldest son of Vanessa), John Lehmann, James Strachey (brother of Lytton), George Duckworth and others connected in some way with the Leslie Stephen family or the Bloomsbury Group of writers and artists.
G.A. Holleyman.
All the books from Monks House and Victoria Square, i.e. 2,617 items comprising 3,740 volumes, together with the portion of the Monks House library purchased by Bow Windows Bookshop of Lewes, are now in the library of the Washington State University, Pullman,  U.S.A.

"Verses intended to go with a posset dish to my dear little god daughter were sent to Julia I presume soon after Virginia's birth 25 Jany 1882.     The original copy belongs to Virginia. "
Opposite, facing this on another end paper is the following inscription in ink, also in the hand of Leslie Stephen:
"Verses intended to go with a posset dish to my dear little god-daughter Virginia Stephen
In good old times,  which means, you know
The time men wasted long ago -
And we must blame our brains or mood,
If that we squander seems less good -
In those blest days when wish was act
And fancy dreamed itself to fact,
Godfathers used to fill with guineas
The cups they gave their piccaninnies.
Performing functions at the Chrism
Not mentioned in the catechism.
No millioner, poor I fill up
With wishes my more modest cup;
Though had I Amalthea's horn,
It should be her's, the newly born;
Nay, shudder not - I should bestow it
So brimming full she could not blow it.
Wishes aren't horses;   true, but still
There are worse roadsters than good-will.
And so I wish my darling health
And (just to round my couplet)wealth;
With faith enough to bridge the chasm
'Twixt Genesis and Protoplasm,
And bear her o'er life's current vext
From this world to a better next,
Where the full glow of God puts out,
Poor reason's farthing candle doubt -
What more can godfather devise?
I've wished her healthy, wealthy, wise;
But since there's room for countless wishes
In these old-fashioned posset-dishes
I'll wish her from my plenteous store
Of these commodities, two more -
- 65
Her father's wit, veined through and through,
With tenderness which Watt - but, phew1.
Julia's aflame - I mean no stricture
On his Sir Josh surpassing picture.
I wish her next, and 'tis the soul
Of all I've dropped into the bowl,
Her mother's beauty - nay, but two
So fair at once would never do -
So let her but the half possess -
Troy was besieged ten years for less.
Now if there's any truth in Darwin
And we from what was all we are win,
I simply wish the child to be
A sample of heredity -
Enj oying to the full extent
Life's best, the unearned increment
Which Fate, her godfather to flout
Gave him in legacies of Gout
Thus then, the cup is duly filled;
Walk steady, dear, lest all be spilled."
A second copy of LOWELL'S LETTERS which also belonged to Leslie Stephen is in the possession of Prof. Quentin Bell.   The poem has been copied in in full by Leslie Stephen with slight differences in punctuation, with the following notes:
"I copy these verses of Lowell's from a copy made by Virginia's mother.   As the original is not forthcoming at this moment I fear that they might otherwise be lost.
L. Stephen.    20 May 1895"
"The original copy is in the dispatch box of Lowell's letters.
L.S."
(Julia Stephen died on May 5th 1895)
This copy also contains the signature of Gerald D'Etang Duckworth (Virginia's half brother).
The poem is printed in full in Frederick W. Maitland's LIFE AND LETTERS OF LESLIE STEPHEN (1906) with the following note -
"When wife and friend were both gone, Stephen sent a copy of the following verses to Mr. Norton and they were printed among LOWELL'S LAST POEMS one line accidentally dropped out and one proper name being changed.   They will gain, I think, by being reprinted in this place, and there is no reason now why the 'original reading' should not be restored. "
- 66 -
Maitland also quotes a letter from Leslie Stephen to Mr. Norton dated October 29th 1893 in which he acknowledges receiving copies of LOWELL'S LETTERS from him as a gift -
"Your letter came a few days ago and was followed in due course by your volumes. "
The silver posset dish is now in the possession of Prof. Quentin Bell and the original poem is believed to be among the collection of Lowell's Letters to Leslie Stephen in Harvard University Library.

Together with the 1st edition of WAVERLEY in 3 vols, uniformly bound with these volumes which appears in the Monks House catalogue (Sect. 5 p. 21) we have 28 titles and 69 volumes.
This collection of Scott was found in a wooden carton in Monks House and there seems little doubt that this was the set which belonged to Leslie Stephen.   Quoting one of Leslie Stephen's daughters (undoubtedly Virginia) Maitland in his "Life of Leslie Stephen" refers to it as follows:
"The long line of red backs the 32 volumes of the Waverley novels, which provided reading for many years of evenings, because when we had finished the last he was ready to
begin the first over again............     In the last years
of his life when he was tired of reading anything else, he would send one of us to the book-shelf to take down the first of the Waverley novels that happened to present itself, and this he would open at random and read with quiet satisfaction until bedtime."
- 69 -
Although the total number of volumes in this collection far exceeds the 32 volumes mentioned by Virginia, the number of titles represented is 28.     This is the total number of fictional works by Scott known as the Waverley Novels.    (See Lowndes Bibliographers Manual and Cambridge Biography of English Literature Vol.4).
The red colour of the spine and the considerably worn condition of most of these volumes makes it almost certain that this was the set of Scott to which Virginia refers as belonging to her father.
In one volume there are some pencil figures on one of the back end papers which are undoubtedly in the hand of Leslie Stephen.
The only other set of Scott in the two houses was a 25 volume set in green cloth with Virginia's signature and the date 1931 in Vol.9. (Monks House catalogue Sect. 2 p. 8).

Vol.47   Bookplate of Charles Edmund Rumbold inside front cover.
This is the best and most complete of Voltaire's collected works.   It was edited by Voltaire himself and later by Beaumarchais.   Published by Kehl.   The type used had been purchased from The Baskerville Press in England.
This set of Voltaire was obviously one of Leonard's most prized possessions.    It was the only literary work he took with him when he went to Ceylon in October 1904 and it came back to England with him in 1911.     The four following references to this work are from Leonard Woolf's autobiography -
Vol.11 "GROWING"   Autobiography of the years 1904-1911 p. 12    "All that I was taking with me from the old life as a contribution to the new and to prepare me for my task of helping to rule the British Empire was 90 large, beautifully printed volumes of Voltaire * and a wire-haired fox-terrier. "
1.   The 1784 edition printed in Baskerville type.
p. 23   "I spent a fortnight,  which included Christmas, in Colombo and on January 1st or 2nd, 1905, now a Cadet in the Ceylon Civil Service on a salary of £300 a year, I set out for Jaffna with a Sinhalese servant, my dog, a wooden crate containing Voltaire, and an enormous tin-lined trunk containing clothes."
p. 37 "A particular liability was my 90 large volumes of Voltaire. Socially and psychologically they did me no good, and materially throughout my years in Ceylon caused considerable difficulty when I was moved from one station to another and they suddenly had to be transported over hundreds of miles in country which sometimes was without a railway.     I am a little proud of the fact that socially I lived down the 90 volumes and physically brought them back to England in fair condition, neither repudiating Voltaire spiritually and socially nor abandoning him materially. "
p. 65   "He (Dutton) was extremely nervous and suspicious and for some time the interview and the conversation were awkward, but eventually, when he found that I had read as many books as he had - or even more - and that I did not think poetry funny, he agreed to take me in, and I and my Voltaire joined Dutton and his Home University Library. "
It is interesting to note that Leonard persistently quotes the wrong number of volumes, the set being in 70, not 90, volumes.
- 17 -


It is also interesting to observe that only one volume (Vol.52) has notes on back end papers in the hand of Leonard Woolf.   This need not however be significant as although almost all the books Leonard reviewed had his pencil notes at the end these reviewing activities were still many years ahead, and we need not infer therefore that any volume without notes had not been read by Leonard.
It may seem odd too that whereas a great many of the books he owned at school and at the university were signed by him, this work, his most treasured literary possession, was not signed.
At the time of Leonard's death about 20 of these volumes were in the library at Monks House, the remainder being in the Victoria Square house, in London.

BY

This copy is of particular interest.   The blue linen cloth
was clearly intended as a cover for a copy of Leonard &
Virginia Woolf's "TWO STORIES" the first book ever to be
published by the Hogarth Press in 1917.
This cover was probably rejected as the wording had come
out too indistinctly.
This item has been compared with three copies of "Two
Stories" in the possession of Mrs. Trekkie Parsons, one
of which is bound in identical large grained blue linen cloth.
FRY (Roger)   SLADE LECTURES. boards 1938.
4to
Blue marbled paper sides. Morocco spine.    Paper label by Virginia.
This appears to be a Proof copy.    Bound inside the front cover is an Index leaf listing the chapters, in the hand of Virginia Woolf.   On some pages there is a rubber stamp "Cambridge University Press   15 Oct 1938".   There are also some corrections in the text in pencil and ink which are believed to be in the hand of Helen Anrep who lived with Roger Fry in his later years
This book was published under the title "LAST LECTURES" in 1939.

Leslie Stephen.
There were three sailors in Bristol city
That took a boat and went to sea;
But first with beef and captains biscuit
and pickled pork they loaded she;
But very soon they were so greedy
they didn't leave not one split pea.
Says Guzzling Jack, the eldest sailor
I am confounded hungery:
Says Gorging Jim, the second sailor
We've nothing else, so we must eat we:
Then let's draw lots says Guzzling Jackie
Vitch shall be skivered of us three:
Draw lots and vy says Gorging Jimmy,
'Oh Guzzling Jack what a fool you be'
There's little Bill vat is young and tender
ve're old and tough so let's eat he.
'O Bill, ve're going to kill and eat you
"So undo the collar of your cheme1.
Poor little Bill he vept and trembled
Vile Jim pulled out his snickersnee;
Let me say one prayer says little Billy
One prayer my mammy taught to me:
Let him say his prayers says Guzzling Jackie
Don't let it be long says Jim says he:
Bill hadn't finished his catechism
When up he starts, there's land I see'.
There's Portugal and Spain to larboard
And on t'other side its Germany
t.o.
- 3 -
There's the British fleet alying at h anchor And wittles on board so you needn't eat me: So when they came alongside the H admiral He flogged fat Jack and he hanged Jimmy -And as for Bill, why the Hadmiral made him the captain of a seventy three. Then take advice ye Wapping sailors and say your prayers when you go to sea."
